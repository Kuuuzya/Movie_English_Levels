1
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,519
This is the story of two girls
who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:22,599
They have a neighbour, Nick,

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,358
who likes Bridget.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,359
But Annie likes Nick.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,160
That is until Hector arrives from Argentina,

6
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:37,679
and Hector is very, very handsome.

7
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Oh. Argentinian.

9
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:38,919
Maybe...

10
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,239
Hector, please,

11
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,240
call me Gigi.

12
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,799
'Oh, Hector, call me Gigi.'

13
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,038
-  A.
-  Is Hector still asleep?

14
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,959
Yep.

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,399
Hector, wakey- wakey.

16
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,238
Come on. Rise and shine.

17
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,239
Sweet.

18
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Good morning.

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
Oh, good morning.

20
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,719
No, no, no. Good morning.

21
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,439
-  Ah- ah- ah.
-  Oh.

22
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Good morning.

23
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,919
Ah- ah- ah.

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,920
No, Hector.

25
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,280
-  I have a cold.
-  And so have I.

26
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,359
Oh, you have a cold, Bridget.

27
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,959
Yes, I have a cold.

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Yes. We have a cold.

29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,320
So let's begin again.

30
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,919
Good morning.

31
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:36,399
Good morning.

32
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,439
Oh, never mind.

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,878
Hector, would you like some...

34
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,879
new pyjamas?

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,558
Hector, please excuse me for a moment.

36
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:51,559
Pssst. Annie. Bathroom.

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,439
Now.

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
-  Good morning.
-  Good morning.

39
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,199
Is it fancy dress?

40
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,038
Fancy dress?

41
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,078
Yes.

42
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,079
Oh. Nice.

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
Hey.

44
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,598
Nice car, eh?

45
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,599
I have this car at home.

46
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,278
Wow. You have this car at home?

47
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,279
Girls must love you.

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Girls?

49
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,639
-  No.
-  No?

50
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,039
Hector, can I tell you something?

51
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,919
OK.

52
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,919
The car looks good.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,919
Yeah?

54
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,920
So you must look good too.

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,519
-  I look good.
-  No.

56
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,520
You don't look good.

57
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,240
But I can help.

58
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
OK.

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,798
OK.

60
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,558
Yes.

61
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:55,559
-  Hector's clothes are awful.
-  They're so old- fashioned.

62
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,758
I know. I'll take him shopping.

63
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,759
But, Bridget, you are so busy.
I'll take him shopping.

64
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,760
-  No, it's all right, I'll take him shopping.
-  It's no problem, I'll take him.

65
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,319
I said I'll take him shopping!

66
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,320
You need...

67
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
You need a...

68
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:35,119
Well, hi, babe.

69
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,319
-  Oh, it's you, Nick.
-  Oh, hi, Nick.

70
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,359
Hector has asked me what clothes to wear.

71
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Yeah, right.

72
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,680
You need a look

73
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,320
like on a fast bike.

74
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,799
No, no, no, Hector, don't listen to Nick.

75
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,039
-  Listen to me.
-  OK.

76
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
You need a designer look.

77
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,159
No, no, no, Hector, that's not for you.

78
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
You need,

79
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
you need...a cowboy look.

80
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,359
-  No, no. A leather jacket.
-  A bandanna and a vest.

81
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,360
A denim shirt.

82
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:51,239
-  A motorbike.
-  Designer.

83
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Cowboy.

84
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,878
Stop.

85
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,879
OK.

86
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,358
I will go shopping.

87
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,398
-  What?
-  On your own?

88
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,078
But...you need us.

89
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,638
How? What will you say?

90
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,639
Er...

91
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,240
It's OK. Leave it to me.

92
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,839
I am the shopkeeper, you are the customer.

93
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
-  Uh?
-  This is a shop.

94
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:59,079
-  I sell, you buy.
-  Oh, OK.

95
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,759
Ding- dong.

96
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,559
Good morning.

97
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Good morning.

98
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Can I help you?

99
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Yes. I...

100
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,919
I would like...

101
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Oh. I would like...

102
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:52,359
a jacket, please.

103
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,638
Trousers.

104
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,639
I would like a pair of trousers, please.

105
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,999
Oh, I would like a pair of trousers, please.

106
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And...

107
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,959
a shirt.

108
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,759
No.

109
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,799
Shoes.

110
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
I would like a pair of shoes, please.

111
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,320
I would like a pair of shoes, please.

112
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,439
And a cat for my head.

113
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
I think you mean a hat.

114
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,480
This is a cat.

115
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,799
A cat? A cat for my head.

116
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,759
A cat for my head!

117
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,119
Hector. Come shopping with me.

118
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,479
-  Or me.
-  No, me.

119
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,480
-  He's my pen friend.
-  All right.

120
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Me, you and you will go shopping for Hector
a little bit each.

121
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,518
I will go to the shoe shop.

122
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,519
And I will go to the clothes shop.

123
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
No, I'll go to the clothes shop.

124
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
OK. I'll just buy the shirt.

125
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,799
I'll buy the trousers.

126
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Good.

127
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,039
Good.

128
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,638
Right. Let's go.

129
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,598
Oh, no. I completely forgot.

130
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:37,358
We need eggs, lemons and dog food.

131
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:40,359
Oh, it's all right. I'll do it online later.

132
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,320
'Eggs, lemons, dog food.'

133
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:50,119
Oh, well done, Hector.

134
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Bye, Hector. Oh, and don't answer the phone.
It might be the tarantula.

135
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,159
OK.

136
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,278
Bye, Hector. Be good.

137
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,279
And if you can't be good, be careful.

138
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,478
-  Huh?
-  Never mind.

139
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:14,479
..new pyjamas.

140
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,198
I'll take him shopping.

141
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,199
Me, you and you will go shopping for Hector
a little bit each.

142
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,760
You need a cowboy look.

143
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:46,239
You need a look like on a fast bike.

144
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,199
Good morning, sir.

145
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I would like...

146
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,120
a cat for my head!

147
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,199
A cat...

148
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,879
Oh. Room service.

149
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,758
Hello. I would like an egg for my head.

150
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,759
Lemons for my head!

151
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,598
-  Dog food for my head!
-  Who's that?

152
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:27,599
The tarantula!

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I said, 'Who's that?'

154
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,079
-  Hello?
-  Where's Bridget?

155
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,679
Er... Where is Bridget?

156
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,399
Me.

157
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
I am Bridget.

158
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,760
I don't believe you.

159
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Yes, I have a cold.

160
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,638
-  Atchoo! Atchoo!
-  Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,438
Oh, thank you. Atchoo!

162
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,918
Charley!

163
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,919
Is that a dog?

164
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,360
No, no, it's not a dog, it's a...

165
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Annie. Yes.

166
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Annie has a cold also.

167
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,638
Oh, poor Annie.

168
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,639
Thank you. Atchoo. Now goodbye.

169
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:49,359
Atchoo! Atchoo!

170
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Ole.

171
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,999
I am Hector.

172
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,360
I speak English.

173
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
'Eggs, lemons, dog food.

174
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
'Eggs, lemons, dog food.'

175
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,198
Oh, hi. Good afternoon, Annie.

176
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,199
Good afternoon, Hector.

177
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
I bought this for you.

178
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What is it?

179
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Try it on.

180
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,718
Try...

181
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:14,719
it...

182
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
on.

183
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,318
Try...

184
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:24,319
it...

185
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,078
on.

186
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,798
Oh. Try it on.

187
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,799
-  Where's Hector?
-  In the bathroom.

188
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
-  It's OK, I'll give it to him.
-  No, it's all right.

189
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,199
Hector.

190
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,678
Hector.

191
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,679
I've got something for you.

192
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,199
Oh. OK.

193
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Come in.

194
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Spoilsport.

195
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,359
Hector?

196
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Hector?

197
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
-  Hello?
-  Here are your clothes.

198
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,039
You will look so cool.

199
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,999
-  Cool?
-  Cool.

200
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Cool.

201
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,119
Nice melons.

202
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,519
Melons? Who are those from?

203
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,238
I think Hector has been shopping online.

204
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,759
I'm really thirsty. I need a drink.

205
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,760
-  But we don't need any melons.
-  Well, he did try.

206
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,080
And he bought some eggs.

207
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Yeah.

208
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Just a few.

209
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Nice melons.

210
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,039
Just a few.

211
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Thank you.

212
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,680
Try...

213
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,640
it...

214
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,998
on.

215
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,358
I've got something for you.

216
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,198
So how did Hector do the shopping?

217
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:05,199
Hector ordered ten melons
instead of ten lemons.

218
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Oh, an easy mistake. He did try.

219
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,280
Yes, he did try.

220
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,679
-  What about the eggs?
-  OK. Eggs.

221
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,680
You buy a dozen eggs, yeah?

222
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,518
Yep. A dozen is ten.

223
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,519
A dozen is 12, stupid.

224
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:44,199
I know.

225
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:47,239
Well, Hector has put the number 12 here.

226
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,759
Well, that's OK. That's one box.

227
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,959
No. He ordered 12 boxes.

228
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
144.

229
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Now...dog food.

230
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,639
I can't wait.

231
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,640
OK. I'm ready.

232
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
-  We're ready.
-  Enter.

233
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Do you like it?

234
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Well?

235
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,238
Er... I like the shirt.

236
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,239
-  I like the sarong.
-  I like the shoes.

237
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,680
So...

238
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,279
am I cool?

239
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Erm...

240
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,359
No.

241
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,360
I'm not cool.

242
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,680
Er...no.

243
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:08,439
So...I will go shopping.

244
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Here we go again. Hector.

245
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
You can't go out there on your own.
You went shopping on the Internet.

246
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Yes.

247
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Your ordered melons instead of lemons
and too many eggs.

248
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,480
-  Have you ever been to a supermarket?
-  No.

249
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,799
My...

250
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Who are these?

251
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:46,239
My...

252
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,080
-  Servants?
-  Yeah. My servants.

253
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
-  Servants. Now I understand.
-  Come on, Hector.

254
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:04,718
-  I will teach you how to shop, Hector.
-  Till you drop.

255
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,719
Bridget and I will be the shopkeepers.

256
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,118
And you are our customer.

257
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,119
OK.

258
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,399
-  Good afternoon.
-  Good afternoon.

259
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Can I help you, sir?

260
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,758
What would you like to buy?

261
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,759
Oh. I would like some...

262
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Clothes.

263
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,318
Yes. I would like some clothes, please.

264
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,319
What size?

265
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,920
What erm, erm...

266
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,398
size?

267
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:04,399
I don't know.

268
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,398
I'll have to measure you, then.

269
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:25,238
Arms up, please.

270
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,238
Arms up, please.

271
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:31,239
Arms up, please.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Chest.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
112 centimetres.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Chest, 112 centimetres.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And waist.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
82 centimetres.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waist.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
82 centimetres.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And leg.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  I'll do that!
-  No, it's OK.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I shall do that.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eight...

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
y- seven centimetres.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, do you like these trousers?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you like this shirt?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good. That's erm...

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
??5,000, please.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OK.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, no, no, Hector.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
??5,000 is...

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
is...

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
8,000 dollars.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's too much. It's too expensive.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not for Hector.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I am ready to go shopping.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  Good luck.
-  Yeah. Good luck.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll need it.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's my lemon drink, Nick?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nick, are there any more tissues?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All right. I'm coming as fast as I can.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OK.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh. I feel awful.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me too. Nothing will make me feel better.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can you get that, please, Nick?

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, it's only Hector.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well?

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it...cool?

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow, man. Well done, you look great.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would like a shirt, please.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excellent. Oh, the clothes are super.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And a pair of trousers.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh. You are clever, Hector.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And a pair of shoes, please.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have been shopping!

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, I'll get it.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  It's me.
-  Oh, hello.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the tarantula.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  Fine, thank you.
-  Oh, good, good.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  How's your cold?
-  How's my cold?

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  Well, how do you know I have a cold?
-  You told me this morning.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  I am Bridget.
-  I don't believe you.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes. I have a cold.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  Thank you.
-  Oh, I'm sorry.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes. Silly me.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you this morning.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are 400 tins of dog food here for Annie?

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pardon?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  How strange.
-  400 tins!

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, that's a lot of tins. I really don't know.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  Can you ask Annie?
-  Yes, I'll ask Annie.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodbye.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The tarantula said

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
