1
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,239
This is the story of two girls
who share a flat in London.

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,280
They have a visitor from Argentina

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
who speaks only a little English.

4
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:29,478
What the girls don't know, but Nick does,

5
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:31,878
is that Hector is very, very rich.

6
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,879
Does Hector like Bridget?
Does Bridget like Hector?

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,079
And who does Nick like?

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Stand by for Extra.

9
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:19,919
Job...stuntman.

10
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,040
Age...20. 20?

11
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,559
No. 30, more mature.

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,560
Age...30.

13
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:35,679
-  Where's the fire?
-  It's the smoke detector.

14
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,719
I know that! Where's the broom?

15
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,559
Oh, good, it's stopped.

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,958
I think this was the problem.

17
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,319
Anyone for very hard- boiled eggs?

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,320
-  Nick.
-  Eh?

19
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:56,999
-  Are they your eggs?
-  Eh?

20
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,479
I thought so!
What on earth are you doing? Are you crazy?

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,798
Ah. Are my eggs ready?

22
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,799
Oh... Your eggs, Hector.

23
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,959
Hector's eggs, Bridget.

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,279
Is he crazy?

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,519
Hector...the eggs are, erm, ruined.

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Perhaps some cornflakes instead?

27
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:23,279
Thank you, Bridget.

28
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,718
Hm. Perhaps some cornflakes instead?

29
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,038
What are you doing on our computer anyway?

30
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,039
Nothing.

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,239
Let's just say, girls,

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,558
one day you will say,

33
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:44,559
'Brad Pitt... Urgh! Pah!

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,040
'Johnny Depp... Urgh! Pah!

35
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:53,558
'Nick from next door... Vroom- vroom- vroom!

36
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:56,439
''The coolest stuntman in the world.''

37
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,079
Oh, you a stuntman!

38
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,078
Yep. I got the job on the Internet.

39
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,518
Well, nearly. I'm waiting for confirmation.

40
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,519
Oh, how exciting!

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,240
The coolest stuntman in the world.

42
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,319
On a moped, right?

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,999
On a Harley- Davidson, actually.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,918
Films! Those stars! That money!

45
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,919
Oh! Oh!

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,680
Have you seen Carina's dress in the magazine?
I'd love to have a dress like that.

47
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,079
Mm, me too.

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,360
It would really suit me.

49
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,598
-  How much is it?
-  Oh, let's see. Erm...

50
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,599
How much?

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,280
Oh, I'm a student. It's too expensive for me.

52
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,039
I've got a job and it's too expensive for me.

53
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:59,559
We need more money.

54
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,959
Money?

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,599
Bridget, Annie, I have something to tell you.

56
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,798
Hector, don't. It's a secret.

57
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,799
''The Romero family,
one of the richest families in Argentina.''

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,639
Keep it a secret. Shh. Eh?

59
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,518
Shh.

60
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,759
What's a secret?

61
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,760
You have been very kind.

62
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,798
Yes, Hector.

63
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,799
I'm sure Bridget and Annie
have a little money.

64
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,999
Shh, Nick.

65
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,960
So I want to...

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,238
I want to give you some money.

67
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,238
Yes?

68
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,239
So, I am going...

69
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,359
to look for a job.

70
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Oh... That's a great idea, Hector.

71
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,679
Great!

72
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,039
Yeah, we can look for a job on the Internet,
can't we?

73
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,519
-  OK, here we are. Job vacancies.
-  Well, let's see.

74
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,479
Oh. Well, there's a job in a launderette.

75
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Hector!

76
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
No.

77
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,719
And there's a job as a gardener.

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,720
My plant!

79
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,678
No.

80
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:22,679
Erm, here's a job as a cook.

81
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:27,719
No.

82
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,278
Wait a minute. Look at this.

83
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,279
A waiter!

84
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,078
What a great idea!

85
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,079
Yes! Ooh, I love good- looking waiters!

86
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,239
Did you say good- looking? Here I am.

87
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,559
What about Hector as a waiter?

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,558
A waiter?

89
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,038
Yeah. You know.

90
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,039
Oh, but I don't know how.

91
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,559
Oh, don't worry. I will teach you.

92
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,039
Hello.

93
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Howard!

94
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,558
How are you?

95
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,559
(Laughs) Oh, thank you, Howard.

96
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,759
Me? Dinner tonight?

97
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,278
Seven o'clock at the Singing Parrot Cafe.

98
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,279
OK, Howard.

99
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,599
Bye, Howard.

100
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,199
That was Howard.

101
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,198
No!

102
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,199
He's invited me to dinner tonight

103
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
because he wants to...
talk to me about a new job!

104
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,999
Who is Howard?

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Bridget's boss.

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,198
He is so rich, he's so clever
and he wants to see me!

107
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,398
He might offer me a promotion.

108
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,399
What shall I wear?

109
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:11,439
I have nothing to wear!

110
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
No! Wrong!

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Huh!

112
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,280
So last season.

113
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:32,479
Bet Howard can't ride a motorbike.

114
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:36,159
Nope.

115
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,440
I hope he does give Bridget promotion...

116
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,558
Although I have heard Howard has a nickname.

117
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:03,559
(Bridget) What was I thinking?

118
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,920
What?

119
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:12,359
The Octopus.

120
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,439
The Octopus?

121
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,718
Oh, The Octopus!

122
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,719
Is he meeting her alone?

123
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,199
Yes.

124
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,400
No, no!

125
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,879
-  Bridget needs help.
-  We must stop her.

126
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,759
I have an idea.

127
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,638
Why don't you eat here?

128
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,518
No!

129
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,519
Yes, then we can both talk to your boss
about your new job.

130
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Here?

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,759
No. No way.

132
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,760
I could cook for you.

133
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,199
Huh! Definitely not, no.

134
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
And I could be your waiter.

135
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,719
N...

136
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,359
I want to be your waiter.

137
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Yeah, OK, then, but be serious.

138
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Don't worry,
we will help you get your promotion.

139
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,599
Leave it to us.

140
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,639
I am going...

141
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,640
to look for a job.

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,918
My plant!

143
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:09,919
Hm.

144
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,718
A waiter?

145
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:18,719
Yeah. You know.

146
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,879
OK, Hector,

147
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,598
you are the waiter so you must set the table.

148
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:29,959
Yes, I have set the table

149
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,960
but there is one problem.

150
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,719
A problem?

151
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,720
The table is too small.

152
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,959
-  The table is too small?
-  Yes. Look.

153
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,158
Hector, this is set for 12 courses.

154
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,159
Dinner at home is always like this.

155
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,399
Well, yes! You are a million...

156
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,480
You are a millionaire.

157
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,238
This is just a little dinner for Bridget's boss.

158
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,398
-  OK?
-  OK.

159
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,518
OK. I am the customer.

160
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,519
Where would you like to sit?

161
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,638
Hm.

162
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,639
Here.

163
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,119
Oh, I... Erm...

164
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,120
The bill.

165
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,799
Not yet. The menu first.

166
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,599
Oh, sorry. Erm... The menu.

167
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Ah.

168
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,839
Forget the menu. What have you got today?

169
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,039
-  To eat?
-  To eat.

170
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Today, as dish of the day,

171
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,719
I have a delicious hot cat.

172
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
-  A hot cat?
-  Mm- hm.

173
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,519
That's a hot dog.

174
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Ah! Hot cat, hot dog!

175
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:08,239
Cat...hot...dog...

176
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,678
Oh, no!

177
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,679
Oh, how's it going?

178
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:20,119
Great! Nick is a good teacher.

179
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,358
-  Let's see.
-  Uh- uh. Hector's Cafe is now closed.

180
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:29,359
Oh!

181
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,559
I'll get it.

182
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Delivery, Miss Evans and Miss Taylor.

183
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Thank you.

184
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,479
Oh! Bridget, look!

185
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,480
''For lovely Annie from H.''

186
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,238
''For beautiful Bridget from H.''

187
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,839
-  Who's H?
-  Oh, it must be Howard!

188
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,799
Ooh, what is it?

189
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Oh, Bridget!

190
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,278
Look, it's Carina's dress!

191
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,279
But how did he guess?

192
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,959
Oh, he's a clever man!

193
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:23,439
Anyway, it's not Carina's dress now,
it's Bridget's dress!

194
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Oh, thank you, Howard!

195
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:29,719
Oh, Bridget, isn't your boss kind?

196
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,720
But why did he buy me one?

197
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,958
Oh, I've told him all about you.

198
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,878
Me? Dinner tonight?

199
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,759
He's so clever and he wants to see me!

200
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,238
Oh, thank you, Howard.

201
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:45,239
-  The Octopus!
-  Ugh!

202
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,758
We will help you get your promotion.

203
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,759
Wow!

204
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
OK, Nick?

205
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,119
Yeah. Hot. The soup, hot.

206
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Uh- uh- uh- uh- uh. The soup is hot.

207
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Thank you, Hector.

208
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,279
He's here.

209
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,280
-  Good evening, Howard.
-  Ah, Bridget, my princess!

210
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:20,359
Please come in.

211
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,680
Bridget, you look divine.

212
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,198
Oh, this must be Annie.
Are you sisters? Such beauty!

213
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,319
The dresses are exquisite.

214
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,919
Oh...

215
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,798
Thank you.

216
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,799
-  Thank you.
-  Don't thank me. It's a privilege.

217
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,278
Oh, and this, of course, is Nick.

218
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,438
Hi.

219
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:52,198
And this is Hector. He's from Argentina.

220
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,199
-  Hello.
-  Argentina?

221
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,199
-  Do you have a cow?
-  Two million.

222
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:05,479
-  What?
-  My parents own two million cows.

223
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,559
Er, yes, thank you, Hector.

224
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,358
-  Hector's English is a little...
-  Weird.

225
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:17,359
Never mind, Hector.

226
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,438
-  So, Bridget...
-  Ooh!

227
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:23,398
What a beautiful apartment for a beautiful lady.

228
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,638
Dinner is served.

229
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,598
Hector, go on.

230
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,478
Today we have sick pea soup.

231
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:32,479
Mm. Sick pea soup. My favourite!

232
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,999
Chickpea. Chickpea.

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Er...chickpea soup.

234
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
This guy is great.
Where did you find him?

235
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,518
Sick pea soup!

236
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,519
Mind you, it does look like...bleurgh!

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Sorry, Nick.

238
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,919
Main course. Teeth casserole.

239
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Teeth casserole?

240
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Beef. Beef.

241
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,838
Sorry. Beef casserole.

242
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,358
I bet the beef is as hard as teeth.
A dinner with bite!

243
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,359
Oh! Sorry, Nick.

244
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,319
So, Bridget, you would like a better job?

245
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Well, Howard, I...

246
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Are you willing to work harder, huh?

247
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Agh!

248
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,599
You stupid idiot!

249
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,159
Sorry, er...

250
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,279
And, Bridget, with your good looks...

251
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,640
What a creep.

252
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,759
Hey! It's cold!

253
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:42,399
Hector! I want hot coffee.

254
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,039
He wants hot coffee.

255
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,318
Then he will have hot coffee.

256
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,039
So, by the age of 20

257
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,039
I had 50 people working for me.

258
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,998
Fascinating.

259
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,919
My father said,

260
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,478
''If you want more money, you must work hard.''

261
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,639
Hey! You have poisoned me!

262
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,958
You fool! You stupid boy!

263
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,239
Stupid?

264
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,998
Don't you dare
talk to my friend Hector like that!

265
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,999
Oh, what is he?
Is your boyfriend or something?

266
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,838
He is...

267
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,839
a kind and clever and lovely man,

268
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,119
which is something that you will never, ever be.

269
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:24,319
So you can keep your job, you creep!

270
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:27,399
-  And we'll send you back the dresses.
-  What dresses?

271
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,879
Oh, these dresses,
the ones you bought Annie and me.

272
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,880
I did not buy those dresses.

273
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
I would not spend money on you! Ha!

274
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,518
Goodbye, Howard.

275
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:45,519
You've lost your job.

276
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Well, too late. I quit!

277
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:54,479
Howard said he did not buy the dresses.

278
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,759
So who did?

279
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,959
If H isn't for Howard...

280
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,799
Then H is for Hector!

281
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
You? But why did you buy the dresses?

282
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:11,758
To say thank you.

283
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,118
But they're so expensive.
Where did you get the money?

284
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,679
I...found it.

285
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,359
Well, these expensive dresses
must go back to the shop.

286
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Yes, they must.

287
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:29,119
But not until tomorrow.

288
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,120
That's right! Let's go clubbing!

289
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,399
Come on, Nick, Hector!

290
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,278
See you later, boys!

291
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,279
Hector, you are a true, true friend.

292
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Money is not everything.

293
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,959
So, what did you buy me?

294
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,080
What do you think?

295
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,840
I love you. I love you.

296
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,038
Hm. One moment.

297
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,798
You didn't buy me a bike.
You didn't buy me a bike.

298
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,158
You didn't buy me a bike.

299
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,078
OK?

300
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,079
Thanks, Hector. It's really, really...

301
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,600
It's OK, Nick.

302
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,279
Hop on. I'll give you a lift.

303
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Hey...

304
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So do you still want to be a waiter?

305
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:48,319
No, I want to be like you, Nick. A stuntman!

306
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,158
Aaagh!

307
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,998
Next time in Extra...

308
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:56,959
Nick gets a job on TV

309
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Annie loves watching TV

310
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,839
And why does Hector want to learn to cook?

311
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840


312
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,759


313
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,760


314
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,080


315
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,440


316
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600


317
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,720


318
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,679


319
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,680


320
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,640


321
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,718


322
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:46,358


323
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,119


324
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,120


325
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,119


326
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,279


327
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:01,359


328
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,559


329
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,118


330
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,119


331
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,959


332
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:19,558


333
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,559


334
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,599


335
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,799


336
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:37,839


337
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,798


338
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,799


339
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,359


340
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,560
