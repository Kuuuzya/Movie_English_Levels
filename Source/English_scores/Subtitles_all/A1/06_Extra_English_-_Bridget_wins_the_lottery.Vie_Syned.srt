1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,640
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,280
and the boys next door,
Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:27,759
Annie fancies Nick

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,920
but Nick fancies Bridget

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,439
who fancies Hector.

6
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,759
But guess what. Hector fancies Annie.

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,758
How are they going to solve their problems?

8
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,719
Stand by for Extra.

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,720
More money! It's my lucky day.

10
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:25,279
Now, where was I?

11
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,879
99, 100.

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Good, that's done.

13
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Now the cushions.

14
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:43,679
In my special order,

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,880
orange, pink, purple...

16
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,879
-  Hi, Bridget.
-  Hi, Hector.

17
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Red.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hi, Annie.

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
-  I'm just...
-  No!

20
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,638
Bridget, no!

21
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,639
It's OK, Bridget, you didn't see it.

22
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,320
You didn't see it!

23
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,559
What are you wearing? Take it off!

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,120
What?

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,478
Your shirt. It's that colour.

26
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,759
Take it off.

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,760
This shirt? What is wrong with the colour?
What's wrong with yell...

28
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:42,399
Don't say it! Don't say that colour.

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,679
Just take it off

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,680
and throw it out.

31
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,759
OK, OK.

32
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,479
Done?

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Done.

34
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,959
Bridget must not see anybody
wearing that colour.

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,359
Why?

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
Because that colour...

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
is very unlucky for me

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,280
and today is Lotto day!

39
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Lotto day. What...

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,878
The lottery.

41
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,879
I pick five numbers.

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,799
My numbers are: 66, 11, 89,

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,039
18 and 69.

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,040
If my numbers are the same
as the lottery numbers on television,

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,718
I win millions!

46
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,719
I've never heard of it.

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Bridget gets very excited.

48
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:53,279
But I know how to keep calm.

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Yoga.

50
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:05,119
So, there we are, Hector.

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Great. I am going shopping.

52
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,080
-  Do you need anything?
-  Yes.

53
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,919
Could you get my dress
from the dry- cleaner's, please?

54
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:23,999
Dry- cleaner's? OK.

55
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,640
The blue ticket is on the board.

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Got it.

57
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,599
See you later, Bridget.

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
-  Hector!
-  Hi, Nick.

59
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,919
I've just been to see Bridget.

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Yes, I can see.

61
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,399
Anyway, where are you going?

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,400
I am going shopping.

63
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,399
Wait, wait, wait.

64
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Come in here. 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

65
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,599
7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

66
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Pen, pen, I need a...

67
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Pen. 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7. Paper.

68
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:26,758
Paper! 7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

69
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,759
-  Thanks, Hector.
-  What is it?

70
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:32,999
Today I met a girl called Emily.

71
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,399
She is very beautiful.

72
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Long, blonde hair,

73
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,199
-  big...
-  Yes?

74
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,919
..blue eyes.

75
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,598
And she is crazy about me.

76
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:55,879
Where did you meet her?

77
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,199
She was in her sports car.

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
At the traffic lights.

79
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
I asked her for a lift, she said no.

80
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,799
But she shouted her phone number.

81
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,159
7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

82
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,160
I see.

83
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,919
Hey!

84
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,159
Maybe she has a friend or a sister.

85
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Wow, yeah!

86
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:31,798
Let's go out. Today...is my lucky day.

87
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:34,799
Now it's time for the National Lottery.

88
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Good.

89
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,240
Is this my lucky day?

90
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,318
And the numbers are...

91
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,798
Yes?

92
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,799
Hello, Mother.

93
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Yes, well, I'm a bit busy.

94
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,079
Can I call you...back?

95
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
I've won!

96
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Mum, I've won!

97
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,158
I must go.

98
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,558
And those were this week's lucky numbers.

99
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,559
What is it?

100
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,759
Annie...

101
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Bridget, I can't understand you!

102
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,758
Annie,

103
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,759
I have won

104
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,120
the National Lottery!

105
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,919
From now on,

106
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,398
it will be a life of luxury.

107
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,398
Designer clothes.

108
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,399
Exotic holidays.

109
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Luxury homes.

110
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,238
The very best restaurants.

111
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:36,239
Mixing with the stars.

112
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,239
But of course I will give
a lot of money to charity.

113
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,240
No more work,

114
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:48,119
no more bosses.

115
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
In fact,

116
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,959
I'll call now and resign.

117
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,679
Hello, this is Harry Bowler.

118
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,159
Leave a message and I'll ring you back.

119
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,638
Harry, it's Bridget.

120
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,639
I resign!

121
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,280
I quit!

122
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,359
I'm off!

123
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Keep your job.

124
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Goodbye.

125
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,918
Oh, dear.

126
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,919
From now on,

127
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,639
no more bosses for Bridget.

128
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,639
Bridget is the boss.

129
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Now, I'll just get my lucky little ticket.

130
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,280
What is it?

131
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,078
My lottery ticket...

132
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,079
has disappeared.

133
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,879
What?

134
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,240
But the dry- cleaning ticket is still there.

135
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Hector has taken the wrong ticket.

136
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,040
We'll go to the dry- cleaner's.

137
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,880
99, 100.

138
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,559
Got it!

139
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,560
My lottery ticket has disappeared.

140
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Hey, Nick, that waitress really likes you.

141
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Two girls in one day.

142
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Call me...Mr Irresistible!

143
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,518
-  Hi, girls.
-  Hi, Bridget.

144
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,519
Your dress, Bridget. I forgot, sorry.

145
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,559
How did you collect the cleaning

146
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,919
when I had the ticket?

147
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
No, Hector, darling.

148
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,838
You have the wrong ticket.

149
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,599
I have the wrong ticket?

150
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
You have the wrong ticket.

151
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Now give it to me.

152
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Yes, I have it here, Bridget.

153
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:22,999
You have got the ticket, Hector?

154
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,119
Yes, I have got the ticket, Bridget.

155
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:31,239
I have lost the ticket.

156
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,759
You have lost the ticket, Hector?

157
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,760
I have lost the ticket, Bridget.

158
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,679
You've lost the ticket, Hector.
You can't have lost the ticket!

159
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Emily's number is on the back!

160
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Are you OK, Bridget?

161
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,239
The ticket you took from the board

162
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,600
was not the dry- cleaning ticket.

163
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,519
It was my lottery ticket.

164
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,480
My winning lottery ticket.

165
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,200
I am a multimillionaire.

166
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:27,239
But with no ticket!

167
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:30,479
And you,

168
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,479
you can stop smiling
because this is your fault too!

169
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:43,239
OK!

170
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Nick, Hector,

171
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,560
where have you been?

172
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:02,319
Well, first we went to the CD shop.

173
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,440
No, no, no.

174
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,079
First we went to Leo's Cafe.

175
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Remember the waitress?

176
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:25,599
Yeah! She was...

177
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Yes, and...

178
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,519
Then we went to the CD shop.

179
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Then we went to Cool Man.

180
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,079
And then we went to the motorbike showroom.

181
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Stop!

182
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,680
So, you are going back to look for it.

183
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,919
Yes, ma'am!

184
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,920
And don't come back until you've found it, OK?

185
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,358
OK!

186
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:02,039
The ticket must be claimed
by ten o'clock tonight.

187
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,118
Now get going.

188
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:07,119
Yeah.

189
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,919
Understood?

190
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,639
Understood!

191
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,559
You can say that again!

192
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,118
OK, Hector.
I hope you find the ticket. See you later.

193
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:28,119
Whoa! Where are you going?

194
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Well, I am going to the traffic lights.
Emily might return.

195
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I can't ring her because her number
is on the lost ticket, remember?

196
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,958
Yeah, but what shall I do?

197
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,959
Look for the ticket, of course.

198
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,439
Yeah, but what shall I say?

199
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:56,479
Well, you say...

200
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
OK,

201
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,959
I am the shopkeeper.

202
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
You are you.

203
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
-  Great!
-  OK.

204
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,999
Good afternoon.

205
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,119
Good afternoon.

206
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,120
I have lost my ticket.

207
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,239
What sort of ticket?

208
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,598
-  My winning lottery ticket.
-  Your winning...

209
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:39,599
Wait a moment.

210
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,960
You can't say,
'I have lost my winning lottery ticket.'

211
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:04,999
Why not?

212
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,080
Because if they know
it is a winning lottery ticket,

213
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:17,919
they will keep the money, they will hide it.

214
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,279
So you must be someone else.

215
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:37,159
Who?

216
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,078
Someone who can search the rubbish bins.

217
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,079
Search the rubbish bins?

218
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,440
That's it, a dustman.

219
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,398
-  Dustman?
-  Yeah!

220
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:54,399
A dustman can search the rubbish bins.

221
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:58,399
Great idea, Nick.

222
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,319
Yeah, great idea, Nick.

223
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,640
Come on, you need to prepare.

224
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,559
Emily's number is on the back!

225
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,759
Now get going!

226
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,639
-  Hello?
-  Hello?

227
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,640
-  Hector?
-  Hello, Bridget.

228
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,159
Have you found the ticket?

229
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,040
No, not yet.

230
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,039
Well, where's Nick?

231
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040
-  At the traffic lights.
-  What?

232
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,720
At the traffic lights?

233
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,599
Well, call me when you've found the ticket!

234
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Bye...

235
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,479
Leo: Today you will have a big surprise.

236
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,518
-  Well?
-  Well...

237
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,519
-  Well?
-  Well, what?

238
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:22,439
Any luck?

239
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Yes and no.

240
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Yes and no?

241
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The bad news is, I didn't find her.

242
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,799
-  Who?
-  Emily.

243
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Emily who?

244
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,159
Emily, the girl at the traffic lights.

245
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,199
-  The good news is...
-  Yes?

246
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,799
I made ??50 cleaning windscreens.

247
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Where's Hector?

248
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,438
Where's my ticket?

249
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:30,439
Look at the time. It's ten to ten!

250
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,599
Ten to ten? I haven't fed Charley.

251
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Where is Charley? I must find him.

252
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,640
Charley was asleep on my bed this afternoon.

253
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,480
Thanks, Nick.

254
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,839
There you are, Charley.

255
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Charley?

256
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,679
What's this?

257
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Bridget!

258
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Bridget, I found it! Your ticket!

259
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:27,439
-  What?
-  Where?

260
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:33,199
On Nick's bed.

261
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,760
-  Who?
-  On Nick's bed.

262
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,840
-  Well, give it to me.
-  No, give it to me.

263
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:53,879
-  It's my ticket.
-  Emily's number's on the back!

264
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,080
-  It's mine!
-  Give it to me!

265
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:24,159
It's OK, it's OK.

266
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,800
I'll stick it back together.

267
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:38,399
Done!

268
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:41,999
Thank you.

269
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,160
Now I can claim my money.

270
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Hi, Hector.

271
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,040
Poor Hector.

272
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:09,239
I've just found the ticket on Nick's bed.
Isn't it exciting?

273
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:12,439
Yeah, great.

274
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,960
I can call Emily now.

275
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,399
Great.

276
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,559
-  When Bridget has finished.
-  Great.

277
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,318
Hello.

278
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,319
I'd like to claim my prize money, please.

279
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,278
My numbers are:

280
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:41,279
66, 11, 89,

281
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,359
18 and 69.

282
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,158
What?

283
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,159
What do you mean,
they're not the winning numbers?

284
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,719
Well, what are your numbers, then?

285
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
69, 81,

286
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,839
68, 11 and 99?

287
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,840
But how?

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know what happened.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bridget, what were you doing
while watching the lottery?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My yoga.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which position?

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This one.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Exactly.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These are your numbers, but...

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
..this way.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bravo, Hector.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was nothing.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Emily's number.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
7- 9- 4- 6- 4- 6- 4- 7.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's ringing.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Emily there?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No?

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you?

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jack's Taxis?

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Emily, you tricked me!

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What an unlucky day.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, it can't get any worse.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, it can.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The phone call.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My job.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We must get that tape back.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I know just the men

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
for the job.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, no!

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, yes!

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nick, should we be here?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's OK. Bridget said it was OK.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, there is the answerphone.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quick, get the tape!

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Security. Who's there?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Next time in Extra...

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bridget's twin comes to stay.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hector asks Annie on a date.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And why is Bridget being so nice,

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
or is she?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
or is she?
