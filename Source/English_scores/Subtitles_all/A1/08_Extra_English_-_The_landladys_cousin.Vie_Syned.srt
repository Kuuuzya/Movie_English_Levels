1
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:17,119
This is the story of two girls
who share a flat in London

2
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,279
and the boys next door,
Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:26,759
Bridget is interested in Hector

4
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,719
but Hector is very interested in Annie.

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,919
Annie doesn't know.

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,920
So will he get close enough to tell her?

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,838
Find out in Extra.

8
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:24,839
'Dear tenants,

9
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:47,239
'my cousin, your landlady,
is on holiday this week,

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,198
'so I am in charge.

11
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:53,199
'The same rules apply.

12
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:00,719
'No pets, no parties, no visitors, especially boys.

13
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,720
'Yours, Eunice Mountain.'

14
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,119
Eunice Mountain? She sounds terrible.

15
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Worse than the tarantula.

16
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,159
If that's possible.

17
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Do you think she'll say no shelves?

18
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:51,558
She can't. They'll look fantastic.

19
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,559
'The timber shelves
in clear lacquered beech veneer...'

20
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,320
'With six casters...'

21
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,960
'And a TV bench.'

22
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,118
Now, where shall we begin?

23
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:10,119
Annie, it's easy.

24
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,919
Rule number one.
Always read the instructions first.

25
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,719
Well, that will only take a week.

26
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,758
OK, let's have a drink before we begin.

27
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,799
-  Milk, Annie?
-  Yes, please.

28
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,800
'I owe you, Nick.'

29
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,639
There! Well, no milk.
Would you like some sparkling water?

30
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Right.

31
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,278
'I owe you, Nick.'

32
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,279
'I owe you, Nick.'

33
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,119
'I owe you, Nick.'

34
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,120
How dare he?

35
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,598
-  Would you like some cola?
-  Thanks, Bridget, I was looking for that.

36
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,599
Nick!

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,679
Sorry.

38
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,958
Add it to the list.

39
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,638
Or ask your flatmate to buy your food.

40
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,078
Wow!

41
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,118
-  You didn't know Hector was rich?
-  No.

42
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,479
I'll speak to you later.

43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,119
Wow.

44
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,479
What are all these boxes?

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,598
Our new shelves, Hector.

46
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,599
I can help you build them.
Where are the instructions?

47
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,279
Hector, my friend, rule number one.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,398
Never read the instructions.

49
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,399
I see you have a note
from our new landlady, then.

50
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:40,479
Eunice Mountain.

51
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,878
Eunice Mountain. I bet she's the same size.

52
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,879
Hello. It's Eunice Mountain.

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,598
Who am I? I'm Nick, from Flat B.

54
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:51,599
You want Flat A? This is...

55
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,879
Hello. Yes, this is Flat A.

56
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,799
Yes, I am Nick from Flat B.

57
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,998
Yes, I know this isn't my flat.

58
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,158
I want to see you downstairs now.

59
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:04,119
Sorry. OK. Right away.

60
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Well?

61
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,678
Eunice Mountain
wants to see me downstairs now.

62
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,679
Bad luck, man.

63
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,319
Oh, dear.

64
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,038
Ask her if she has any milk, bread and biscuits.

65
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,519
OK, so...

66
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,520
'First open box A
and take out shelf number one.'

67
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,680
But which is box A?

68
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,479
This is box C.

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,439
And I've got box D.

70
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,678
I've got it. This is shelf number one.

71
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,999
No, Hector. This is shelf number one.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,839
No, this is shelf number one.

73
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,958
This is a nightmare.

74
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,318
OK, Annie, read out the instructions.

75
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,239
'Put shelf one against the wall.'

76
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Hector, I think the books will fall off.

77
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:03,119
So what's Eunice Mountain like?

78
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,599
You know, not bad.

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Are you in trouble?

80
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,239
Probably.

81
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,240
I've got it.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
'Put pole B on the left and pole A on the right

83
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,359
'and the shelf on top.' Bridget.

84
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,278
Like this, Hector?

85
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,039
Have you put up shelves before, Hector?

86
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Many times.

87
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,998
Or do your servants do it for you?

88
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,999
-  I'll do it!
-  No, no, no, I'll do it.

89
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,478
Drop! Drop!

90
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,479
I laugh at instructions.

91
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,560
That was clever.

92
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,800
It's OK. I can straighten it.

93
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,719
Stand back and watch the master at work.

94
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Well done, Nick.

95
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,959
So where does this piece go?

96
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,199
Hi.

97
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm Eunice Mountain, your new landlady.

98
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,919
Wow!

99
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,479
Hi.

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,480
Hello. I...

101
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,800
I am Bridget

102
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,479
and this is Annie.

103
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,959
Hello.

104
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,080
And this is Hector from Argentina.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, hello, Hector.

106
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,238
Hector lives next door with Nick.

107
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,038
I've met Nick already, haven't I, Nick?

108
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,078
Yes, that's right.

109
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,678
We need to talk about your rent. In private.

110
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,278
Great.

111
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,878
'Measure the distance between the shelves.'

112
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,959
Annie, hold this, please.

113
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,479
That's it.

114
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,198
And this should be it.

115
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,278
Hector, do you think that's correct?

116
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,279
These shelves are for mice.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,839
Can I speak to you please, Hector?

118
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,840
So, Hector.

119
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,639
'One of the richest families
in Argentina, the Romero family.'

120
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,080
There you are, Hector.

121
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
So why the secret?

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,639
Because I wanted you to like me,
not my money.

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,319
Oh, Hector, of course I do.

124
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Who else knows?

125
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,199
Nick.

126
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
I thought so.

127
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,159
But not Annie. Don't tell Annie...yet.

128
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,839
Why, Hector?

129
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Because, Bridget...

130
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,438
-  Because...
-  Yes?

131
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:06,439
I am in love with Annie.

132
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Nick has entered the building.

133
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,159
So where are you going,
looking like John Travolta?

134
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,679
He has a date with me, haven't you, darling?

135
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,680
Another date?

136
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,359
But that's three times this week.

137
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Four.

138
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:25,479
We've been to dinner,
to the theatre, to the cinema

139
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:32,079
and last night...salsa dancing.

140
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,159
Can you salsa?

141
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
I am the salsa queen.

142
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,159
Yeah, with two left feet.

143
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,160
-  Pardon?
-  Nothing.

144
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
It sounds great.

145
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,799
What is it tonight? Ping- pong?

146
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,279
Tonight's it's karaoke.

147
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,439
And I am the karaoke queen.

148
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,838
Let's go. Bye.

149
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,839
I love you!

150
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,879
I am the karaoke queen.

151
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,880
I bet she sings like a toad.

152
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
So, Hector, where were we?

153
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,959
OK, I think I've got it, Annie.

154
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,759
I did knock, but the music was so loud,
you didn't hear me.

155
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,718
I thought we'd have a little chat.

156
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,998
Rule number two. No underwear on the radiator.

157
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,759
It's dry now.

158
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Give it to me. Give it to...

159
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Thank you.

160
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,279
Let me repeat the rules.

161
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,280
No parties and no visitors.

162
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:28,119
Especially boys.

163
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,118
Especially boys from next door.

164
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,078
Especially Nick.

165
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,079
He's mine.

166
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,318
Get the message?

167
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,398
Yeah, we get the message.

168
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,519
See you later.

169
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,520
By the way, that shelf is not straight.

170
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,799
Bye.

171
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:53,239
Well, I have never...

172
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,078
What does she... Who does she think she is?

173
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:00,079
The landlady's cousin?

174
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,878
I know that, but no Hector and no Nick?

175
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,879
How dare she?

176
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,358
How is Eunice?

177
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:11,359
Problems?

178
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,079
She is very nice.

179
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,078
But?

180
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,079
But she's just not my type.

181
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,279
What do you mean?

182
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Look. Presents.

183
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:29,079
More presents. Flowers.
More presents. Chocolate.

184
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,759
And her energy. I'm exhausted.

185
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Nick?

186
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Let's go dancing.

187
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,599
Hector, get rid of her!

188
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Get rid of her? How?

189
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:49,319
-  Say something.
-  What shall I say?

190
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,119
Anything! Tell her I'm not well.

191
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,998
I've eaten a hedgehog. I've gone to the moon.

192
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:09,999
Nick, are you in there?

193
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,839
-  Go on!
-  OK.

194
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,238
Hi.

195
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:22,239
You're not Nick.

196
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,759
No. Nick's hedgehog has gone to the moon.

197
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,438
Pardon?

198
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:30,439
Nick's hedgehog is not well. Nick is sad.

199
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
So he must come dancing to make him happy.

200
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,920
No! He cannot dance!

201
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,079
Why not?

202
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:58,239
He stood on the hedgehog without shoes.
Very painful.

203
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Oh! Very messy.

204
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,518
So he cannot dance.

205
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,519
Oh, that's a pity.

206
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,639
Well, never mind.

207
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,558
Yeah, sorry. Bye.

208
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,559
-  You'll just have to come instead.
-  Pardon?

209
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,279
Come on, let's dance.

210
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,279
Do you think that's correct?

211
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
'And tighten the screws.'

212
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,878
Annie, you are a genius.

213
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,879
-  Hi, Hector.
-  Hi, Annie.

214
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,039
What's the matter? Are you OK?

215
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,759
I am exhausted.

216
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,760
What happened?

217
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,480
-  Last night Eunice and I...
-  Yes?

218
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,120
-  She made me...
-  Yes?

219
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
..go dancing.

220
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,639
Annie, she dances like a rhinoceros.

221
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Wow!

222
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,198
Annie! The shelves!

223
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:41,078
You finished them!

224
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,079
Oh, just a bit more measuring.

225
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,999
I will help you.

226
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,918
-  Sorry.
-  No, sorry.

227
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,919
Sorry.

228
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,478
It's OK.
It happens when people work together.

229
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:57,479
So, where were we?

230
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,720
'For the final shelf, take...'

231
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,559
Hector!

232
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:09,439
Help! Hide me!

233
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,919
-  Eunice?
-  Eunice.

234
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
Oh, Bridget, save me.

235
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:26,399
-  Why?
-  It's Eunice.

236
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,679
Nick? Oh, Nick.

237
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,359
There she is. She's too much.

238
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,679
I know you are in there, Nick.

239
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,999
Bridget, Annie, I said no boys.

240
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Shall I get rid of her, Nick?

241
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,879
Yes, please. But how?

242
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,958
I'll think of something.
Annie, let Miss Mountain in.

243
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:52,638
There you are, Nick.

244
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,719
And Hector.

245
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,318
Bridget, I thought I said no boys.

246
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,319
Yes, you did.

247
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:08,199
Especially boys from next door.

248
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,199
Yes. Yes, you did.

249
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
-  Especially...
-  Nick. He's mine.

250
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,438
Oh, Nick!

251
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:18,439
Well, I... Just wait until I tell my cousin.

252
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,119
By the way, Hector, I've got a fax for you.

253
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,319
Please, give it to me.

254
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,919
It's from your father. It says...

255
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:47,479
'Coming to London to meet...
the Prime Minister?

256
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,119
'My jet arrives at midday. Will phone. Father.'

257
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,919
Actually, Hector, I think you're more my type.

258
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I don't think so, Eunice.

259
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,760
-  Goodbye.
-  And don't slam the...door.

260
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,238
So, Hector, your father is flying to London
in his private jet to meet the Prime Minister?

261
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:30,239
Well, they are one of the richest families
in Argentina.

262
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,920
-  So, Bridget, where were we?
-  No, Nick.

263
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,959
The trick worked. Eunice has gone.

264
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Annie, I will buy you a million shelves.

265
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,319
Well, we'd better
start measuring for them, then.

266
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:54,078
Next time in Extra...

267
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,079
Nick dresses up.

268
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,478
Bridget is working hard in television.

269
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:04,479
And Hector goes for an audition.

270
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000


271
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,518


272
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,999


273
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,398


274
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,518


275
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,519


276
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,640


277
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,998


278
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,999


279
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,879


280
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,318


281
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,319


282
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:51,199


283
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200


284
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,560


285
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:08,399


286
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:11,358


287
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,359


288
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,679


289
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,158


290
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,159


291
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,839


292
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,398


293
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,399


294
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,958


295
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,959


296
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:04,479


297
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,800


298
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,838


299
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,839


300
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,680


301
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000


302
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:34,199


303
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:38,079


304
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,120


305
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,478


306
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:55,479


307
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400


308
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:06,399


309
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,718


310
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:12,518


311
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,799


312
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,800


313
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,799


314
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,279


315
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,280


316
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,760
