1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,680
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,280
and the boys next door,
Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
Bridget has a job with Channel 9

4
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,559
and so does Hector, he's a reporter.

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,519
Annie just wants to save the animals

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,520
and Nick... Well, Nick is Nick.

7
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,799
Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What?

9
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,760
-  Nick!
-  Who is it?

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,840
It's me. Annie.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And this is Ziggy.

12
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,799
-  Is Hector there?
-  No.

13
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,719
-  He's working tonight.
-  Then you must help us, Nick.

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,720
Take these.

15
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,319
They are my babies,
so look after them, please!

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,878
Sure, no problem.

17
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,879
Right. Ready, Ziggy?

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Come on, let's go.

19
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,718
Hurry!

20
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,719
Yes, three o'clock. Tell the others.

21
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,879
Bye.

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,880
'Animals are human?'

23
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:22,999
Annie, animals are animals.

24
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,438
-  But animals are like people.
-  Really, Annie?

25
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,638
Look at this flat. How can I get ready?

26
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,639
-  Sorry, Bridget.
-  I have a very important day today.

27
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,160
-  Sorry.
-  I have big, big decisions to make.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Like...which dress.

29
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,319
What do you think?

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,759
They're both nice.

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,760
I have such a busy morning.

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,640
David Beckham, Madonna.

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,720
What? You're meeting them?

34
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,880
No, I'm reading about them

35
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,080
and then I'm having lunch with guess who.

36
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:32,559
Yes, you've guessed it.

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Leonardo DiCaprio!

38
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Leonardo and me!

39
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,159
Wow! Leonardo DiCaprio?

40
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,160
Just you and him?

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Well, nearly.

42
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,560
There'll be 45 journalists there too

43
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,958
but really it's just me and gorgeous Leo.

44
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,798
You and 45 others?

45
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,799
I see.

46
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Anyway, this cosmetic factory
experiments on animals for make- up

47
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,038
and I really feel...

48
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,638
Good, Hector, you're here.
Now you can help me choose.

49
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,639
You're back, Hector.

50
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Was it a difficult night at work,
snuggly puppykins?

51
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Yes, and the bad news is
that Eunice wants me to go straight back.

52
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,599
Why?

53
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,839
There is a big news story happening today.

54
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,840
So, Hector,

55
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:55,999
which dress do you like the best?

56
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:02,239
This one.

57
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,920
-  You're sure?
-  OK, that one.

58
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,239
But you just said this one first.

59
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,679
Yes, I know, but...

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Bridget, I am going to Channel 9 now.

61
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
-  Are you coming?
-  Yes, Hector.

62
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,799
And I can tell you
all about Leonardo and me!

63
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
The guinea pigs!

64
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:33,159
Nick?

65
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Good. They're OK.

66
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,479
I'm coming.

67
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,558
Ziggy, come in.

68
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,959
Right, now, there are the posters.

69
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Now, a note for Nick.

70
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Ready, Ziggy?

71
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,639
Bye, Charley. Wish us luck.

72
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,278
Wait a minute, Ziggy.

73
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,279
OK, right, let's go.

74
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Wish us luck.

75
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,479
Yes, three o'clock. Tell the others.

76
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,158
Bye.

77
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,159
Leonardo and me!

78
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,639
Wow!

79
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Leonardo DiCaprio?

80
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,758
I have big, big decisions to make.

81
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,158
Which dress?

82
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:49,159
Hector. At last.

83
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,398
I want you to go
straight to Garrier's cosmetic factory.

84
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,399
Why?

85
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Because some horrid hippies
are protesting there.

86
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,719
Why?

87
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:09,959
Because they think Mr Garrier
experiments on guinea pigs for make- up.

88
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,960
This is nonsense.

89
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,399
Guinea pigs?

90
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,318
You know,

91
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,919
guinea pigs.

92
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Guinea pigs! How sweet.

93
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,158
And these hippies
have stolen his guinea pigs.

94
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,159
Poor Mr Garrier adores his little guinea pigs.

95
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,599
He wants them back.

96
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,319
He told me over dinner last night.

97
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,679
Who is Mr Garrier?

98
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,798
Mr Garrier owns Channel 9.

99
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,799
And Mr Garrier has said

100
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,280
we must make these protesters
look very, very stupid.

101
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,279
Now get going!

102
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,440
OK, Eunice.

103
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,599
I want their heads!

104
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,239
Eunice?

105
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,279
Yes, Bridget?

106
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,320
Is there anything I can do?

107
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,519
Yes.

108
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,560
I have a very important job for you.

109
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,079
Get me a coffee. Black, no sugar.

110
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,240
No, Bridget.

111
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,440
I can't, I'm a married man.

112
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,238
What?

113
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,759
Crazy, man!

114
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Guinea pigs!

115
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
They are my babies,
so look after them, please.

116
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,079
Yeah, sure, no problem.

117
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Yeah.

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Annie.

119
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,879
Annie!

120
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,478
OK, my little beauties.

121
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,479
Time for breakfast.

122
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:39,599
Come on.

123
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
'Nick, very important. Keep my babies safe.
I will call you. Annie.'

124
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,639
Does she think I'm stupid?

125
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,159
Of course you're safe with me.

126
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:56,599
Now, let me introduce myself.

127
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,440
My name is Nick.

128
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Yeah, hello there.

129
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
Now, what's your name?

130
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:43,319
Kevin? How do you do, Kevin?

131
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:52,239
And who's this?

132
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Janice?

133
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,759
Is she your girlfriend, Kevin?

134
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:26,039
OK, it's not that funny.

135
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Janice, I think you're very pretty, OK?

136
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,079
So!

137
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,919
These are all your friends.

138
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,079
Wow!

139
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,280
There are eight of you.

140
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,798
You must be hungry.

141
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,799
Shall Uncle Nick get you
something nice to eat?

142
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,798
OK.

143
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,598
Have they split up?

144
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:57,599
Hollywood's most beautiful couple.

145
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,998
Yes!

146
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,758
Yes!

147
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,238
Garrier out! Garrier out!

148
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:08,239
All right, Eunice, I cannot hear you.

149
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,680
I said,

150
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,758
find the leader.

151
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,558
The what?

152
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,559
The coordinator.

153
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,758
Which one?

154
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,759
Her, her! That one!

155
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,279
The one with the big ears.

156
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,478
Garrier out! Garrier out!

157
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,479
-  Hello.
-  Hello.

158
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:07,719
This isn't a tea party. Ask her a question.

159
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:12,158
OK.

160
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,159
So how important is this protest?

161
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,039
Well...

162
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Well, yes, it's very important

163
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,599
because this factory, Garrier's,
experiments on animals for make- up.

164
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
And why is that bad?

165
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:36,319
Because the poor...

166
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,519
Because the poor animals are suffering.

167
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,999
That's dreadful. The poor things.

168
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:07,318
Poor little things.

169
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:09,758
They're just guinea pigs!

170
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,759
Hector, remember who Mr Garrier is?

171
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,958
You do want your job.

172
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,959
OK, OK.

173
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,960
OK, so do you think
this march will help the animals?

174
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:26,239
It's Hector and Annie.

175
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,919
-  This march is important.
-  Wow, man!

176
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,079
We must stop Mr Garrier!

177
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,279
I see.

178
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,799
These scientists are using poor animals
to test on hair dye,

179
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,919
lipstick, mascara, blusher.

180
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,920
They use...

181
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,079
Well, tell her. Tell her...we need make- up!

182
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,279
And where are the eight guinea pigs
they stole from the laboratory?

183
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,878
I bet she knows. Ask her.

184
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,599
Ask her.

185
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,958
OK.

186
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,959
And do you know anything
about...some stolen guinea pigs?

187
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
The guinea pigs are safe.

188
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,118
Yeah, they're safe with me.

189
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:26,119
Aren't you, my pretty ones?

190
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:29,079
I bet she's got those guinea pigs.

191
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,080
-  Ask her! Ask her!
-  OK.

192
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,319
Have you...

193
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,839
Louder, you idiot!

194
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Have you got...

195
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,840
We've got her! Ask her again! Ask her again!

196
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:05,439
Have you got the guinea pigs?

197
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,320
Hector, why are you doing this?

198
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,640
You know I love animals.

199
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,840
I'm sorry, Annie. It's my job.

200
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,919
Well, you can keep your job!

201
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:26,439
Annie, please! Wait, I'm coming!

202
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,720
This is Hector Romero for Channel 9 News.

203
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,679
Annie, please! I can explain.

204
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
Wait!

205
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
OK, my little beauties.

206
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,199
They're safe with me.

207
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Aren't you, my pretty ones?

208
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,358
Have you got the guinea pigs?

209
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:54,359
Hector, why are you doing this?

210
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,440
This is Hector Romero for Channel 9 News.

211
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Annie, please, I can explain. Wait!

212
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,558
Bridget DiCaprio.

213
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,559
Mrs Leonardo DiCaprio.

214
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,440
Leonardo and Bridget DiCaprio.

215
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,479
'Hello, Mrs DiCaprio!'

216
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,518
'Call me Bridget.'

217
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,519
'Is Leonardo there?'

218
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:32,479
'No,

219
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,840
'he's on the beach with
our two beautiful children and the dogs.'

220
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:42,399
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

221
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:51,199
So aren't you going to ask me
about my lunch?

222
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,360
-  What did you do that for?
-  Aren't you going to ask me about my lunch?

223
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,440
-  What lunch?
-  My lunch with Leonardo.

224
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Leonardo who?

225
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,319
Leonardo DiCaprio, of course.

226
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,119
So, Bridget, how was your lunch
with Leonardo DiCaprio?

227
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Gorgeous!

228
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,680
I was so funny.

229
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,239
He loved me, he loved my dress,
he loved my name.

230
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
-  That's nice.
-  Now close your eyes.

231
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Go on, close your eyes.

232
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Ready?

233
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,399
What do you think?

234
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,399
-  Very nice.
-  It was very expensive

235
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,119
but it's worth it
because tonight I'm going to a premiere.

236
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:53,159
I can't wait!

237
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,319
I wonder if Leonardo will be there.
Now I must get ready.

238
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Tonight this little lady's going to shine

239
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Tonight this little lady's going to shine

240
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Annie, I can explain. Listen.

241
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,438
Annie, please talk to me.

242
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,439
Hey, guys. Great interview.

243
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,558
You were not fair, Hector.

244
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,559
-  You were asking awful questions.
-  Yeah, they were pretty bad.

245
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
It wasn't me.

246
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,079
It was Eunice.

247
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,080
The guinea pigs!

248
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Nick, where are they?
I must take them to the animal sanctuary.

249
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,439
We've been having a lovely time,
haven't we, my friends?

250
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,519
Hello. They're not here.

251
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,839
What do you mean, they're not here?

252
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,240
I mean, they're not here.

253
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:06,678
So where are they, Nick?

254
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,679
Everywhere?

255
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,919
I'll get it.

256
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,719
Hello.

257
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Hi, Eunice.

258
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,038
Yes, Eunice.

259
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,078
OK, Eunice.

260
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,479
No, Eunice.

261
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,480
OK, Eunice. Bye, Eunice.

262
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,119
-  It was Eunice!
-  No!

263
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:01,279
And after what happened today,

264
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:06,479
she says that I...

265
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Hector!

266
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:18,079
Your job! She's fired you!

267
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:23,199
I'm so sorry, Hector.

268
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:27,239
It's all my fault.

269
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:33,318
She says that I must tell you

270
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,319
that she is so pleased with the interview,

271
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,840
she wants Channel 9
to fight against animal cruelty.

272
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Channel 9's new motto is...

273
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,440
Animals are human.

274
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,959
That's fantastic news!

275
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Good old Eunice.

276
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,720
What about Mr Garrier?

277
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,039
She said, 'Don't worry about Mr Garrier.'

278
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,118
-  Right, let's find those guinea pigs.
-  Yes, right away.

279
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:17,119
Right, we've found seven of them.

280
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,560
There's just one guinea pig still missing.

281
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
He's probably watching us.

282
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:44,439
Yeah, and laughing at us.

283
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,519
Hello?

284
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,798
OK, right.

285
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,799
-  Bridget, your taxi's here.
-  I'm coming.

286
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:10,959
New girlfriend, Nick?

287
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,798
Right, everyone,

288
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,839
I'm just off to my premiere.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did I mention it?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Proper acting.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps you could learn something, Nick.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No spare ticket.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Still, I'll tell you all about it later.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't wait up.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Next time in Extra...

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The friends go on holiday to Spain.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bridget finds her prince.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Nick finds his princess.
