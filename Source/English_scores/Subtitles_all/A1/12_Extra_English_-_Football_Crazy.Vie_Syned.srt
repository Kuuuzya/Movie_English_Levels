1
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,840
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,120
and the boys next door,
Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,240
Hector is dating Annie

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,079
and Bridget wants to go out with Miguel...

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,359
and all Nick wants is a job.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,319
Stand by for Extra.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,919
Nearly ready. There we are!

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,920
Perfect!

9
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:14,999
Now the living room.

10
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,078
Oh, there!

11
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,559
Just there!

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,560
Yeah, perfect, baby!

13
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Now, refreshments.

14
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,879
Cola, yes!

15
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,759
Crisps, yes!

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
And finally...

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,238
Dial- A- Pizza. Yes!

18
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:50,239
Only two hours to go!

19
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:52,598
Nick!

20
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,399
What is your television doing in my bathroom?

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Hi, Bridget.

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,200
-  So I don't miss anything.
-  Miss anything?

23
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,919
Yeah, if I have to,
you know, when the match is on.

24
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,959
Oh, the match.

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,960
So, who's playing today?

26
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,839
It's the semi- finals. England...

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Versus...

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Argentina!

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,399
Hey, Hector, great outfit, but wrong team.

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,238
And I've got my lucky World Cup pants on.

31
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,239
Your lucky World Cup pants?

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,039
Yep. I don't change them
when the World Cup is on.

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,038
-  But it lasts for weeks.
-  Yeah.

34
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,519
So, Hector, I've got the refreshments ready.

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Cola, crisps...

36
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,199
TV in the bathroom.

37
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,760
-  At what time is kickoff?
-  Midday.

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,280
We had better sit down, then.

39
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:20,918
Hello, everyone.
Charley and I are ready for the match.

40
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,919
Annie, you look nice!

41
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,159
-  Your ribbons are different.
-  That's right.

42
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,520
One for England and one for Argentina.

43
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,439
How sweet!

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,560
But of course England will win.

45
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,680
I don't think so, Nick.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We beat Jamaica 4- 2.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,039
But we beat Italy 3- 0.

48
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Well, our strikers are the best in the world.

49
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,958
But your defence is poor.

50
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,518
-  No, it's not.
-  Yes, it is.

51
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,038
It's not! It's not! It's not!

52
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,838
It is! It is! It is!

53
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,839
Break!

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,758
And now make friends.

55
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,719
You're so childish.

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,599
Miguel arrives today.
At least he's a real man.

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
But he loves football too.

58
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
A Spanish supporter.

59
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,879
-  Hello?
-  We'll beat them, in the final.

60
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,958
Nick, for you. Your agent.

61
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,959
Goody!

62
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,959
Hi, Cameron. How are you?

63
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,919
Good. An audition?

64
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,879
For me?

65
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,559
What for?

66
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,560
London On Fire?

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,800
The soap? Yes!

68
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,520
When?

69
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,638
Today? At midday?

70
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,439
Where?

71
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,718
Birmingham?

72
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,719
But that's 100 miles away.

73
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,518
No, of course I'm pleased.

74
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,719
OK, thank you.

75
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,118
Bye.

76
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,958
An audition for London On Fire? That's brilliant.

77
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,999
Yeah, you must be pleased, man.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, I am.

79
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,080
I am very, very pleased.

80
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,079
I am so happy.

81
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
I can see that.

82
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,799
Why today?

83
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Why this afternoon?

84
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Why in Birmingham?

85
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,158
What about the football?

86
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,158
It's only a football game.

87
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:24,518
Bridget,

88
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,918
there are some people who think
that football is a matter of life and death.

89
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,519
It isn't.

90
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,318
It is much more important than that.

91
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,319
-  Don't go to the audition, then.
-  Don't go?

92
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,759
Don't go? I must go.

93
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,879
Drama is my life.

94
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,959
Look, Nick, we can record it for you.

95
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,318
Yeah, and we won't tell you the score.

96
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,319
Really? You won't tell me the score?
You promise?

97
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,719
-  Promise.
-  Promise.

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
OK, promise.

99
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,440
OK.

100
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,399
I will go,

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,400
and perform for England.

102
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,959
But of course England will win.

103
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Yes!

104
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,238
I am so happy.

105
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:17,239
I don't believe it.

106
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,920
It's a very, very bad hair day.

107
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,919
And Miguel is arriving this evening.

108
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
It's a disaster.

109
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,599
It's a catastrophe.

110
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,600
I said it's a catastrophe.

111
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,478
What is a catastrophe?

112
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,479
Bridget's hair.

113
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
I've got to do something.

114
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,720
I know. Carol.

115
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:18,198
She'll help me.

116
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,199
..we've got all the action coming up.

117
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Hello? Carol?

118
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:42,918
Bridget here.

119
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,919
Look, this is an emergency.

120
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,599
I need a hair appointment.

121
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
I need a style
that a Spanish football fan will adore.

122
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,640
You can? Goody.

123
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,559
I'll see you at five o'clock.

124
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Sorted!

125
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,278
..this semifinal between the two giants...

126
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,279
Come on, England!

127
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Come on, Argentina!

128
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
..but a strong team.

129
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,080
England look like... Are they going to score?
Yes! It looks like it!

130
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,598
Now Argentina, coming up on the outside.
They're looking dangerous.

131
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,199
They've got through the defence
and they score.

132
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Come on, England. They've got to pull
themselves together. And who's this?

133
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,038
Look at him. He's broken through.
And it's a goal!

134
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,039
A minute to go in this exciting match
and England have possession.

135
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,559
Yes! Yes! Yes! It's gone in!

136
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
What a game!

137
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,439
Yeah, it was fantastic.

138
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Poor Hector.

139
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,480
-  Argentina did very well against England.
-  Yeah.

140
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,320
But not well enough.

141
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,360
We must not look too happy.

142
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,640
We promised Nick not to tell him the score.

143
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,400
And, Hector,

144
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,479
you must not look too sad.

145
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Come on, try to smile.
Come on, snuggly puppykins.

146
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,718
Like this.

147
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:41,719
It'll do.

148
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:45,599
Hi, Nick.

149
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,758
-  Hello.
-  Hi, Nick.

150
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,759
-  Good match?
-  You know, so- so.

151
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,959
Yeah.

152
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,840
-  Where's the tape?
-  Hector's got it.

153
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,038
-  Where's Hector?
-  In your apartment.

154
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,039
-  Bye, then.
-  Bye.

155
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:11,439
Yes!

156
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,119
Hi, Hector.

157
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,559
Nick, my friend, you are back.

158
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,918
Is this is the football match?

159
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,998
Yep.

160
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:25,678
-  What?
-  You won, didn't you?

161
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,679
-  Won what?
-  The football.

162
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:39,119
Argentina beat England, didn't they?

163
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,598
Nick, I promised you I wouldn't say anything.

164
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:46,599
But I know. You're so happy.

165
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,159
No, I'm not.

166
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,560
I knew it. I knew it.

167
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,919
Poor England, my country.

168
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:18,118
Nick, you can watch the match on video.

169
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:20,479
I can't bear it.

170
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,480
How, Hector, how could you?

171
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
How could Argentina beat England?

172
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,199
Nick,

173
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
just watch the tape.

174
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
I can't wait to see Miguel.

175
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,519
I'm going to the hairdresser's to get my hair
done for gorgeous Miguel. Bye.

176
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Hello.

177
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,678
OK, repeat after me.

178
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,679
Bridget, you are so beautiful.

179
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,679
Bridget, you are so beautiful.

180
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
Bridget, I love your hair.

181
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,359
Bridget, I love your hair.

182
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,919
And your smile.

183
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,518
And your smile.

184
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,519
No problem, Miguel. See you later.

185
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,799
Hector and Bridget!

186
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,798
How could they?

187
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,799
Argentina did very well against England.

188
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,399
Yeah.

189
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
But not well enough.

190
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,279
This is an emergency.
I need a hair appointment.

191
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,280
I need a style
that a Spanish football fan will adore.

192
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Bridget, you are so beautiful.

193
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Annie.

194
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,238
-  Annie?
-  Yes, Hector?

195
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,119
-  Are you all right?
-  Yes.

196
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Are you cross about something?

197
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Why do you think that?

198
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,399
Annie, come and sit down.

199
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,839
Yes!

200
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,318
Annie, have I done something wrong?

201
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,319
Yes!

202
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Goal!

203
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,838
Well, if you don't tell me, I won't know.

204
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,839
You know, Hector. You know.

205
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Yes! Yes! Yes! We won!

206
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,640
We won!

207
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
We're in the final!

208
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:40,719
Sorry, have I missed something?

209
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Bridget?

210
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:56,199
Bridget, what's wrong?

211
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,039
Why have you got a bag on your head?

212
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,318
-  Come on, let's take it off.
-  Leave it!

213
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,039
Is it your hair?

214
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,040
It can't be that bad.

215
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,519
It is!

216
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,439
Come on.

217
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:29,479
Do you promise not to laugh?

218
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,040
We promise.

219
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Don't we?

220
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:45,719
All right, then, here goes.

221
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:49,839
It's very...

222
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,719
nice.

223
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,599
I knew it!

224
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,600
I knew you'd laugh!

225
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,919
It's a disaster
and Miguel will be here any moment.

226
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,920
That's him!

227
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,359
He mustn't see me like this.

228
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,758
Miguel?

229
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,278
Come in.

230
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,799
I'll just tell Bridget.

231
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,438
Bridget. Miguel's here.

232
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:22,439
I don't want to see him. I can't.

233
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,959
Trust me, Bridget, he will love your hair.

234
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Miguel!

235
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Bridget, you are so beautiful.

236
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,120
I love your hair, and your smile.

237
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,478
I love your hair.

238
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,479
So, Spain versus England
in the World Cup final.

239
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,598
Poor old England.

240
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,438
On the contrary, my Spanish friend.

241
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,319
Prepare to die.

242
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,879
Nick, please ask Hector to pass the crisps.

243
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Hector, Annie says can you pass the crisps?

244
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,238
Please ask Annie
why hasn't she spoken to me for two days.

245
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:12,239
Annie, Hector says
why haven't you spoken to him for two days?

246
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:17,199
Tell him...

247
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,119
She says...

248
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,958
It's starting.

249
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,959
..final between England
and their arch- rivals Spain.

250
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,719
Come on, England. Come on.

251
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Come on, Spain.

252
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,159
He passes to Scholes, and yes...

253
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,160
-  Go on!
-  And here's Spain...and it's a goal!

254
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,680
-  Yes!
-  Goal!

255
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:06,079
England have the ball.
They are heading for goal.

256
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:12,239
Yes!

257
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Annie, can I ask you something?

258
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Yes, Hector?

259
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:27,438
Have you ever thought about getting married?

260
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:30,439
Who to?

261
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
To someone...

262
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,719
Someone like...me.

263
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,720
..and he shoots and he scores!

264
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:51,559
I don't believe it!

265
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
What a match!

266
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,839
Spain played really well.

267
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,679
Yeah, but not well enough.

268
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Poor Miguel. Speak to me in English again.

269
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,279
Bridget, you are so beautiful.

270
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,319
I love your hair and your smile.

271
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:16,239
-  Is that all he knows?
-  Yep, and I taught him.

272
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,240
-  When?
-  On the phone.

273
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:52,199
You were on the phone to Miguel!

274
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,198
-  Teaching him English.
-  Silly me!

275
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:58,199
I thought you were talking to Bridget.

276
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,680
Annie, there is only one person for me.

277
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Me?

278
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,358
Well? Will you?

279
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:13,359
Will she what?

280
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,359
Marry me?

281
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Yes, Hector!

282
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,478
Next time in Extra...

283
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:26,479
Hector and Annie plan their wedding.

284
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,279
Nick is in for a surprise.

285
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,479
And guess who's coming from Argentina.

286
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:05,479


287
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,480


288
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,799


289
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,800
