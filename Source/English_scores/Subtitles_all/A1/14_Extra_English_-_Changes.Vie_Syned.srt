1
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,039
This is the story ofBridget andAnnie,
who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,879
and the boys next door,
Nick and his friend Hector, from Argentina.

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,880
Annie and Hector have decided
not to get married.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bridget and Nick are dating,
but Nick is getting bored,

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,039
so will it last?

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Find out in Extra.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,798
Oh, Bridget...

8
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,799
this is wonderful.

9
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,039
I'm so glad you like it, Nick.

10
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,879
I just can't get enough.
I want more, more, more!

11
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,959
Nick, honey,
there's plenty more where that came from.

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,760
-  Nick?
-  Yes, Bridget darling?

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,998
-  How long have we been together now?
-  Erm...

14
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,999
We've been together two days, Nick.

15
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,839
Wow! That long? Hmm!

16
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,158
Yes, it is a long time, Nick.

17
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,159
But if...we are to...

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,520
continue our relationship,

19
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,799
you must...

20
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,958
Will you...?

21
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,959
Will you treat me like a lady?

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,199
Bridget darling, just call me Gentleman Nick.

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Nick! Nick!

24
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,479
You must... There must be more...

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Snogging!

26
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,680
There must be more respect.

27
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,919
Oh, Nick.

28
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,198
Let's see what sort of gentleman you are.

29
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,199
Here's a little test. Follow me.

30
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,240
-  Well?
-  Well, what?

31
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,039
I want to go out.

32
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,319
-  Oh.
-  So...

33
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,320
-  What do you do?
-  Oh!

34
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,358
-  Kiss you goodbye!
-  No.

35
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,359
You open the door for me.

36
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Huh? Ah!

37
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,478
Because I am the strongest!

38
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,479
Rahr! Rahr! Tarzan!

39
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Oh, come on, Ziggy, we'll be late.

40
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Is just you and Ziggy doing this protest?

41
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:39,799
Yes, but when other people see how important
it is, they'll join us. We must stop...

42
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,079
Oh, excuse me, Annie.

43
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,080
-  Problems?
-  What? Oh, no, no, no.

44
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,118
-  No problems at all.
-  Oh, look! There's Ziggy. Must dash.

45
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:55,119
-  Have fun!
-  This is not fun. This is serious.

46
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,479
This is serious too.

47
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,479
Now, clothes.

48
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,159
What?

49
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,558
I want you more...like David Beckham.

50
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:18,439
Ah, like this!

51
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Now, where is it?

52
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:24,679
Aha! Here it is.

53
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Now, come here.

54
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,879
-  Really, Bridget, I don't think...
-  Oh, don't be silly, Nick.

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,640
There! That's better.

56
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,680
Now, we must go deeper.

57
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,199
There is a bigger problem.

58
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,520
You have a lot of anger in there.

59
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:04,239
Well, yes, I am wearing this stupid hair band.

60
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,040
So, we must work on your inner calm.

61
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,160
I want to see your chest.

62
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,879
OK!

63
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,718
Lie down.

64
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:39,359
Close your eyes...

65
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,360
and relax.

66
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Ahhh!

67
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,958
Now, this may tickle a bit.

68
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,959
-  Ready?
-  Yeah.

69
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Here goes!

70
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,038
Just feel that anger go!

71
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,039
Acupuncture never fails.

72
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:14,559
-  Oh, hi, Mrs Romero.
-  Hello, Bridget. Where is Hector?

73
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,559
Hello, Mrs Romero.

74
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,839
Do you remember Nick, Mrs Romero?

75
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Time to party!

76
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
I can't forget him.

77
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Oh! Hola, Mama!

78
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,918
Sorry I'm late.

79
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,478
-  Coffee?
-  Oh, yes, please.

80
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,759
Excuse us, Mrs Romero.

81
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,358
Come on, Nick, I'm taking you shopping.

82
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,398
-  Uh- uh.
-  Oh? So you want some more acupuncture?

83
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,399
OK, OK, I'm coming, I'm coming.

84
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,440
And don't forget your money.

85
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:36,359
Rahr! Rahr!

86
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:47,359
Oh, you are learning quickly.

87
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,360
I want you more like David Beckham.

88
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Ah, like this?

89
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,239
Wow! That long? Hmm!

90
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,279
Oh! You are learning quickly!

91
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Mother, when in London, we speak English.

92
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,039
Yes, we must. English is the language
of high class, so I must teach it...

93
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,399
Learn.

94
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,880
-  You must learn it, not teach it.
-  Oh, yes.

95
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,919
So your father has found you a wife.

96
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:45,439
He told me. He must stop shopping on eBay.

97
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:48,999
Look, Mum, I don't want a wife.

98
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,399
I've got Annie.

99
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,039
This girl is from a good family.

100
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,879
-  So is Annie.
-  This girl is rich.

101
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,118
I don't care about money.

102
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:12,119
But she's almost royalty.

103
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,879
Mum, Annie is my princess.

104
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,880
But she's so...

105
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,680
She's so clever, so kind, so happy!

106
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,078
-  Annie?
-  Very happy!

107
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,079
What happened?

108
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,399
Ziggy and I were in a field lying down.

109
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Sunbathing?

110
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,640
-  Protesting.
-  And...?

111
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,800
It began to rain!

112
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,359
Oh, poor Annie.

113
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Don't touch her!

114
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Now, listen, Mum, I've told you I love Annie.

115
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:08,319
Be careful, your pullover.

116
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,879
Hector, your mother's right.

117
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Don't touch me!

118
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:21,039
Why did you do that?

119
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,639
Because I love you, darling.

120
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
If you knew Annie, you would love her.

121
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,558
Well, I'm going home tomorrow.

122
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,559
Look, Mum, come to dinner tonight
and you will meet the real Annie.

123
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,240
And if you don't like her, then...

124
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,039
then I might marry the princess Dad has found.

125
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Annie?

126
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,200
-  Annie.
-  Yes, Hector?

127
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,398
-  Can we talk?
-  If that's OK with your mother.

128
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,918
Oh, Annie, she's gone to her hotel now.

129
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,919
Look, she's going home tomorrow

130
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,320
and I thought
we would invite her to dinner tonight.

131
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,798
Well, I'm going out.

132
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,799
Annie, please don't be silly.
Stay and be nice to her.

133
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,599
She is OK, really.

134
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Well, OK then.

135
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,560
But you must do one thing for me.

136
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Sure. What?

137
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,039
-  Scrub my back.
-  Oh, but I am still dressed.

138
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
So am I. Well, I can't put these
in the washing machine. They're filthy.

139
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,879
Apricot?

140
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,560
No. Annie, will you behave?

141
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,840
-  When?
-  When my mother comes to dinner.

142
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,639
Probably.

143
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Strawberry.

144
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:17,719
Annie, I have an idea.

145
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,719
Nick is pretending to be someone different.

146
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,198
Nick isn't pretending. This is the new Nick.
Isn't it, Nick?

147
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,199
You can pretend as well.

148
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,639
You can pretend to be what my mother wants.

149
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:36,399
What, Princess Caroline of Monaco?

150
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Look, Nick is pretending
to be what Bridget wants.

151
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,359
Yeah, a slave.

152
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,439
How can I help?
As you can see, I'm a talented stylist.

153
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Could I have some more cola, please, sweetie?

154
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,880
My mother is coming to dinner tonight.

155
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,639
Oh! So what's on the menu?

156
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,839
I am!

157
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,678
What sort of food does your mother like?

158
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,679
Babies on toast?

159
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,678
I don't know. A traditional English dish.

160
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,199
I am not going to pretend to eat meat.

161
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
How about roast Annie?

162
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,080
I know.
What about sweet and sour prawn balls?

163
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,798
-  Sweet for me...
-  And sour for Hector's mum!

164
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,118
Nick, behave.

165
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:38,119
Very funny.

166
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,760
I will cook dinner.

167
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,119
And Nick will look after your mother
because he's such a gentleman now.

168
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Don't you worry about Mrs R.
She'll have a great time.

169
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:52,038
Leave it to me.

170
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,039
So, Annie, will you pretend?

171
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,839
OK, Hector.

172
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:09,398
For you, tonight,
I will pretend to be the perfect girlfriend.

173
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,399
Annie,

174
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,278
you and I are going shopping.

175
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,318
Too obvious.

176
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,319
Too Margaret Thatcher.

177
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,159
Hector will love it, but, no.

178
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,079
Perfect!

179
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,959
Don't touch her!

180
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,998
Your mother's right. Don't touch me!

181
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,999
-  No!
-  You can pretend to be what my mother wants.

182
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,760
What? Princess Caroline of Monaco?

183
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Perfect!

184
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,159
Yeah, a slave.

185
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,158
Wow! Annie!

186
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,159
You look great.

187
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:17,439
I look 45 years old.

188
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,879
But my mother will like it.

189
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Snap!

190
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:32,119
Versace?

191
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Marks and Spencer's.

192
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,839
Have you enjoyed your visit to London,
Mrs Romero?

193
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,879
I love London.

194
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:52,479
We often visit our friends, Liz and Phil.

195
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,680
And where do they live?

196
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:34,479
Buckingham Palace.

197
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,480
There you are, Mrs Romero.

198
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,839
Oh, you are so handsome, Nick.

199
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,359
Annie has had an interesting day today, haven't
you, Annie?

200
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:02,479
Go on, Annie,
tell Mother about your interesting day.

201
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
OK. Well, our GM protest went very well today.

202
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,880
What's GM?

203
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,439
I don't know.

204
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Great Men?

205
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:35,359
A Great Men protest?

206
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:59,399
-  Really?
-  It means genetically modified.

207
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:04,199
Listen, Mum.

208
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:08,239
So, so the farmer came over
to see what we were doing...

209
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Oh, GM, GM! Gorgeous Men!

210
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Ooh!

211
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
-  Another drink, Mrs R?
-  Oh, yes, Nick, please.

212
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,799
You have lovely eyes.

213
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,958
Anyway, he told us to go away,
and when we wouldn't...

214
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,958
There you are, madam.

215
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:34,239
-  Where did you learn your beautiful manners?
-  Oh, I was born with them.

216
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,038
Sit down.

217
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,878
And then the police arrested us,

218
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,879
but I escaped prison so I could be here tonight.

219
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,398
It is a joke!

220
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:51,399
Come on, Mum, talk to Annie.

221
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,679
So, Annie, Hector tells me you like animals.

222
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,919
Oh, I love them, but I don't eat them.

223
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,920
I'm a vegetarian.

224
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,080
How odd.

225
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,159
If we cannot eat animals,

226
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,880
why are they made of meat, then?

227
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,959
You are so funny, Nick.

228
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:02,479
But I do love horses.

229
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,598
Oh, yes, they're wonderful.

230
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,679
And I love riding.

231
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,679
I love your English hunt.

232
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,478
Yes, the dogs, the handsome men in red coats.

233
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:17,479
-  The dead fox.
-  Yes, the dead fox.

234
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:30,239
No! It's cruel.

235
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,759
The poor fox.

236
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,640
What do you know?
You are not from a good family.

237
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,599
There's nothing wrong with my family.

238
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,279
You are not family of beauty.

239
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Well, anyway,
I don't believe that Hector is your son.

240
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He's too good- looking!

241
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,119
Right, that's it.

242
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:09,719
I'm going.

243
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,639
Mum, Annie didn't mean...
Annie, Mum didn't mean...

244
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,479
Yes, we did!

245
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,480
And another thing.
You won't need hounds on a hunt.

246
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:28,318
When the fox sees you coming, he'll run!

247
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,319
Hector, I shall see you in Argentina
for your wedding...

248
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
to our perfect princess.

249
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,559
Well, that went rather well, didn't it!

250
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:53,879
Oh, who is this?

251
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,039
He's darling!

252
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,040
-  Oh, that's Charley. Charley belongs to A...
-  Me!

253
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,319
-  He's my baby.
-  Isn't he gorgeous?

254
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Look, darling, here's Mummy.

255
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,959
Women!

256
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,960
So, Hector,
who's this Latin American princess?

257
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,199
Well, my father wants me to marry her,

258
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
but I will not, of course.

259
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Well, if you don't want her, I'll have her.

260
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
More wine, Nick!

261
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Next time in Extra:

262
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:43,479
Nick gets ajob as a bouncer.

263
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,719
If your name's not on the guest list,
then you cannot come in!

264
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Annie gets a tattoo,

265
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,318
and Hector wants to be a tough guy.

266
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:10,238
Extra, don't miss it.

267
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:12,719


268
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
