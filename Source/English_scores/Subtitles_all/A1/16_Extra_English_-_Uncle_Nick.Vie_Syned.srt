1
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,158
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,

2
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:19,199
who share a flat in London.
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,200
And the boys next door,

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,798
Nick, and his friend Hector,
from Argentina.

5
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:30,799
Annie loves Hector
and Hector loves Annie.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,560
And Bridget and Nick are going out,
most of the time.

7
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:38,599
So, will the happy couples stay together?

8
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,518
Find out in Extra.

9
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,639
Chocolate mousse!

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,640
Peanut butter!

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Strawberry yogurt.

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Nice.

13
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,799
Sorry, Annie. Exams. I forgot!

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,800
I won't make a sound.

15
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,959
Sorry, Annie. I...

16
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,039
Hector! Stop.

17
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:46,639
Do not eat that apple.

18
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,359
Sorry. You want it, Annie?

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,519
No, Hector! It's too noisy!

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,520
I am trying to revise!

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,680
My exams are next week!

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,840
I need some classical music.

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,558
Sorry, Annie, I...

24
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:13,559
Help!

25
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Annie!

26
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,559
Help!

27
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Help!

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,878
Annie?

29
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,879
Annie!

30
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,039
Why is Hector
hanging out of the window?

31
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,760
Poor Hector!

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,480
-  Hector, are you OK?
-  Yeah.

33
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,760
The window is dirty.

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,439
Well, then, it's a job
for a window cleaner, not you!

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,318
Hey, guys, look at these!

36
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,319
It's pictures of my makeover!

37
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
What is a makeover?

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
It's when they use make- up to turn this...

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
into this!

40
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,118
Just joking!

41
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:34,119
Bridget, they're fantastic!

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
You look like a film star!

43
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:44,839
Cameron Diaz, watch out!

44
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,879
Were you wearing lots of makeup?

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
No.

46
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,158
Anyway, what are they for?

47
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,159
Well, Nick wants to be
a Hollywood movie star

48
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:05,279
and if he can do it, I can do it!

49
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Really?

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,920
You are going to tell George Ducas
about me?

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,200
What, the George Ducas,
the Hollywood director?

52
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:22,719
You're going to tell him
what a great actor I am?

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Oh, Victoria!

54
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:32,559
Thank you so much!

55
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,719
How can I thank you?

56
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,558
Can't anyone else do it?

57
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,359
Yes! Of course
I want you to tell George about me!

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,478
No problem.

59
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,318
See you later.

60
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,319
Ciao.

61
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,678
That was my friend, Victoria Yallop,
the really good actress.

62
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,679
Yeah, she's a really good actress.

63
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,639
Nick, darling!

64
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Well, guess what?

65
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,479
She's going to tell George Ducas,
the Hollywood director, all about you.

66
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,480
-  Yeah! How did you know?
-  Lucky guess.

67
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
And what do you have to do for her?

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Nothing.

69
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,679
She wants me
to look after something for her.

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,279
Victoria Yallop. Nick is expecting me.

71
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,319
Nick, darling!

72
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,320
This must be so much trouble for you!

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,520
No problem. No problem at all.

74
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:48,239
Sweet! OK, three rules.

75
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
No meat, clean underpants in the morning
and in bed by eight.

76
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Now meet...

77
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:37,799
Where are you?

78
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,638
Come here!

79
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,639
Nick, meet Lucas.

80
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,518
Lucas, say hello to Uncle Nicky- Wicky!

81
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,238
Hi.

82
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:24,839
Good joke!

83
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,918
Well, I must dash.

84
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,919
George is waiting for me.

85
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:32,999
Don't worry, Nick,
I'm going to tell him all about you!

86
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,838
Lucas, be a good boy
for Uncle Nicky- Wicky!

87
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,839
Don't tell me.

88
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,439
Nightmare On Elm Street.

89
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Goodbye, darlings! Goodbye!

90
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,840
I'm hungry.

91
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Nick?

92
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,799
What is going on?

93
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Victoria's au pair
has run off with the postman.

94
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,959
So?

95
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,960
So, she's got no one to look after Lucas.

96
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,520
So, why can't she look after her own son?

97
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Because
she's going to meet George Ducas.

98
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,960
-  Where?
-  New York.

99
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,519
-  New York?
-  She'll be back tomorrow!

100
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,399
Tomorrow?

101
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,318
He's very sweet
but what about my exams?

102
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:39,919
He won't be a problem.
You won't even notice him.

103
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,920
We'd better not.

104
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,799
Hector! Stop.

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Say hello to Uncle Nicky- Wicky!

106
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,919
Annie, have you seen these?

107
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,039
You showed me earlier.

108
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,399
No.

109
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Look.

110
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:28,719
It's that...that child!

111
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,159
What's that noise?

112
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,438
Lucas is playing ball.

113
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:41,439
Oh, is he?

114
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,280
You've made me do that.

115
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,118
He's on my bike!

116
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:52,119
I know. Just don't go in the bathroom.

117
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,079
I said don't go in the bathroom.

118
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,839
And I don't know what he's done
with the toilet paper.

119
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,559
Poor Charley.

120
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm hungry.

121
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,879
Nick, where have you been?

122
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,919
Shopping for Lucas.

123
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,039
Nick, you must take control of him.

124
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Baby, I'm trying!

125
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Nick, I'm trying to work.

126
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,598
I'm trying to revise for my exams.

127
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,599
OK, OK. Very nice, Lucas.

128
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:39,479
Maybe later?

129
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,600
I know. Let's play games.

130
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:45,719
-  I've got Twister.
-  Great.

131
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Oh, OK, boys versus girls.

132
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,040
So,
I'll just move my left foot over to you.

133
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,119
It is stuck!

134
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,799
OK, I'll move my hand.

135
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,559
Hey, I can't move!

136
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Nor can I!

137
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:10,479
What's happening?

138
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,479
Lucas? What have you done?

139
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,718
Lucas, come here!

140
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,719
Lucas! Come on!

141
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,719
Lucas!

142
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,758
Please.

143
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,759
I'm going to tell him all about you!

144
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,400
I'm hungry.

145
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,918
I'm hungry.

146
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,919
Hi, Lucas! Where have you been?

147
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
To the zoo.

148
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
-  Where's Nick?
-  He had to take the penguin back.

149
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,998
-  The penguin?
-  Yeah. It must have fallen into my bag.

150
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,999
What are you listening to?

151
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:11,119
I said, what are you listening to?

152
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Dog Puppy Dog.

153
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Can I listen?

154
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,959
This is good!

155
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,079
Sorry!

156
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,799
Hector!

157
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,079
Lucas! Come here!

158
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,879
Lucas, why are you so...
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

159
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Hey, that's me!

160
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:21,358
Lucas, do you want to be like me?
A news reporter?

161
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:24,359
Well, to be a good news reporter

162
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,079
you have to do everything exactly as I do.

163
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,160
All good newsreaders brush their teeth.

164
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:39,199
Check.

165
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,318
Comb their hair.

166
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,358
Check.

167
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,359
-  And say good night.
-  I'm hungry.

168
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Check. Good night.

169
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:59,839
Goodnight, sugar plum.

170
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Haven't you got a girlfriend, Lucas?

171
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Girls are wonderful, especially Bridget.

172
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,878
Girls are yuck, especially Bridget.

173
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,879
Yeah, well, anyway, time for bed.

174
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,918
Nick, thank you for a lovely day.

175
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,839
Well, that's OK, little fellow.

176
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,199
We'll have more fun tomorrow. Night night.

177
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Sweet kid!

178
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,399
How does he do that?

179
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,439
I've had enough of you, you little...

180
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Now, sweetie, that was very good!

181
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:46,079
But Auntie Bridget thinks
you should stretch more like this!

182
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Would you like a cup of tea?

183
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,038
Hi, Nick!

184
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,758
This is Joe. He was just telling me
about window cleaning.

185
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,759
So I see!

186
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,519
So, you want my girlfriend, do you?

187
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Thanks, Lucas!

188
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Nick, Joe, stop!

189
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:18,359
No! He started it!

190
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Nick, what are you doing?

191
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Electric shocks!

192
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Check!

193
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,318
How do you do that?

194
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:46,319
Poor Joe!

195
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
I haven't paid him! Joe!

196
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Has Bridget just run off
with the window cleaner?

197
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:04,239
Yep!

198
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Cuckoo! Anybody home?

199
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,519
Lucas, my darling, I'm back!
Give your mummy a hug!

200
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
-  How was George?
-  Wonderful!

201
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:22,439
So, did you tell George about, you know?

202
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,559
You know?

203
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,560
What?

204
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Did you tell George Ducas about me?

205
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,359
What a good actor I am.

206
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,360
I'm so sorry, darling.

207
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,399
I completely forgot!

208
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:21,879
It was all so exciting!

209
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,080
Lucas, you're going to have a new daddy!

210
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,120
George and I are going to be married.

211
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,280
I'm going to be Mrs George Ducas.

212
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,039
Hey! That means
you are going to be Lucas Ducas!

213
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Lucas, come with me
and meet your new daddy.

214
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,559
See? Girls are yuck!

215
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Next time in Extra...

216
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Bridget gets a new computer,

217
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,159
the boys get competitive,

218
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,198
and Annie gets a surprise.

219
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,519


220
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,520


221
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,160
