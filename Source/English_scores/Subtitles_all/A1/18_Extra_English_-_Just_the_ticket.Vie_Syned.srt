1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,720
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:22,159
and the boys next door,
Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,959
Bridget and Hector work for Channel 9

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,960
and Annie wants a job too,
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,640
but Nick just wants
babes, babes and babes.

6
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:39,038
Stand by for Extra.

7
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,039
'Dear Miss Taylor,
thank you for your recent CV,

8
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,119
'but at present we haven't got anything
to suit your talents.'

9
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,039
'Dear Miss Taylor...
Blah- blah- blah- blah.'

10
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,878
How surprising.

11
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,399
What is the point of all that studying
if I cannot get a job?

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Right, last one.

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,080
Paws crossed, Charley.

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,198
'Dear Miss Taylor...'

15
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,479
What is the point of having a car
if you cannot park?

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,480
'Thank you for your recent letter...'

17
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,599
She's got four eyes and reptile skin.

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,558
'We are very pleased to tell you...'

19
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:56,319
-  She sees your car...
-  '..that you have been successful...'

20
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,798
She slides over to it.

21
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,799
She's got you!

22
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:05,559
'..in your application as a...'

23
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,799
Yes, she is the...

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,119
Traffic warden!

25
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,120
-  Correct.
-  What?

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,160
I've just got a ticket.

27
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,079
I've just got a job.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,080
As a traffic warden?

29
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:33,559
-  Annie, you'll be one of them.
-  One of who?

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Annie is going to be a traffic warden.

31
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:43,679
Well, I have to pass
the entrance exam first.

32
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,760
-  What is a traffic warden?
-  Someone who spoils your day.

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,399
A traffic warden is someone
who stops stupid people

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,400
parking their stupid cars
in stupid places.

35
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,279
See? It's started.

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,318
I didn't know
you wanted to be a traffic warden.

37
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,598
I didn't know either,
but no one else would have me.

38
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,359
But it is good for the environment
to reduce the cars on our roads.

39
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,360
-  So you will have another exam?
-  Yeah.

40
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,519
Another exam.

41
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:54,679
Well, don't worry. I can help.

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,718
I've got experience of traffic wardens.

43
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,518
OK, Hector, you can be the driver...

44
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,519
and I will be the traffic warden.

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,360
-  OK.
-  You can't park there.

46
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,960
-  Yes, I can.
-  No, you can't.

47
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:32,199
-  Yes, I can.
-  No.

48
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Yes, I can, because this is a bus stop
and I am driving a bus.

49
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,799
The excuses I hear.

50
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,958
Sorry, sorry.
Emergency appointment.

51
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,959
-  Bad leg.
-  Which leg?

52
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,720
No, no, no, it's not me. It's my hamster.

53
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,599
Sweet.

54
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Sorry, Eric! Eric?

55
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:37,359
Surely we can come to some arrangement?

56
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,519
Of course we can, sir.

57
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,359
You can pay for the ticket,
I can go home for my tea.

58
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Sorry, sorry, but I was late for lunch
and there wasn't a place to park.

59
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:11,078
But surely we can sort this out?

60
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,399
When a beautiful woman
meets a handsome man...

61
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Well, you're in my little black book now,
darling.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,838
I've only been two minutes!

63
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,038
Well, I have started...so I'll finish.

64
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,039
Sorry, I got stuck up a chimney.

65
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,079
Yes, and there are fairies
at the bottom of my garden, sir.

66
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Rudolph!

67
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,519
Rudolph!

68
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,960
See? Now you know what to expect.

69
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,039
I can't wait.

70
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:53,559
'Late ironing -  penalty ?20.'

71
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,519
'Late washing- up -  penalty ?5.'

72
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,399
Annie.

73
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,519
I need a drink.

74
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
I don't believe it.
She's clamped the fridge.

75
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Did you have a good day, Bridget?

76
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,398
-  Yes, I did.
-  Why is the TV moved?

77
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,999
Annie towed it away this morning.
No licence.

78
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Really, Hector, you must talk to her.

79
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:35,238
She's too serious
about this traffic warden exam.

80
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:38,239
I do try, but if I stop to talk to her,

81
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
she gives me a parking ticket.

82
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:44,359
Anyway, exciting news.

83
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,079
Channel Nine is presenting
the Miss Euro babe Beauty Contest.

84
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,240
And guess who Eunice wants
to present the show.

85
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,279
-  Me!
-  You, Hector!

86
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,399
I could enter the contest myself,
but I might...

87
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:02,199
-  Frighten the judges?
-  Win.

88
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,360
The programme will need my expertise.

89
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,039
And mine!

90
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,040
-  So will you present the show, Hector?
-  When is it?

91
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,919
-  Next Friday.
-  That's the day of Annie's exam.

92
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,438
A double contest, then.

93
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:21,439
But you'll be OK. I'll help you.

94
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Think of those babes!

95
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,200
It's my job to give you
all the information about the girls,

96
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
so nothing can go wrong.

97
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,360
-  Well, OK, then.
-  Good. Great.

98
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,919
So, when do we start?

99
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,920
We?

100
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,959
Well, Hector will need an interpreter

101
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,399
to help him talk to all those babes.

102
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,438
Nick, you're not getting involved
in this show.

103
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:07,439
What is the point of having a car
if you cannot park?

104
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
-  What is a traffic warden?
-  Someone who spoils your day.

105
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,239
Sorry, sorry, but I was late for lunch
and there wasn't a place to park.

106
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,240
And guess who Eunice wants
to present the show.

107
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,838
-  Me!
-  You, Hector!

108
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,839
-  Well, OK, then.
-  Good. Great.

109
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,399
You have a very difficult job.

110
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,399
You are right.

111
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,279
But a very important job.

112
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Thank you, sir.

113
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,678
No, I mean it.

114
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,679
I know, but I've still
got to give you a ticket.

115
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,920
That's OK. It's your job.

116
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,919
There you are, sir. Have a nice day.

117
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,279
Thank you. And you.

118
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,238
How nice to meet a reasonable customer.

119
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:25,239
Why are you dressed to go to war, Annie?

120
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,399
I'm going for my traffic warden exam.

121
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Are you expecting trouble?

122
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,639
There are a lot of difficult motorists
out there.

123
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,280
What have you got there?

124
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,440
It's the information
for the Euro babe contestants.

125
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,719
Hector must learn
what each girl likes and dislikes.

126
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,720
-  Anything interesting?
-  Let's see.

127
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,280
She likes children and animals.
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

128
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,999
She likes children and animals.

129
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
She likes children and animals.

130
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,560
This one's different. Miss Holland Babe.

131
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,880
She likes reading and her ambition...

132
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:13,759
is to learn to read.

133
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,399
Here's another one. Miss Belgium Babe.

134
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,998
Her ambition is to go to the moon.

135
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,999
But she doesn't like flying.

136
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,199
Well, it should be an exciting show.

137
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,199
I hope so.
Well, at least Hector is ready for it.

138
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,398
And so...

139
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,399
am I.

140
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,719
I said no.

141
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Cue Hector.

142
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Good evening
and a very warm well...come

143
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,960
to Channel Nine's Eurobaby Contest live.

144
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Yes, OK. Get on with it.

145
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:26,959
Have we got some lovely ladies
for you tonight. Have we?

146
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Yes, of course we have.

147
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,680
Yes, yes, we have. Of course we have.

148
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,079
So let's meet our lovely contestants

149
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,518
eager to wear
the Channel Nine Eurobaby Crown.

150
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,519
Nick, get off now.

151
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,719
Nick! Get off now!

152
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
If you don't get off
by the time I count to three,

153
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,518
I will cut off your ears.

154
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,519
One...two...

155
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,439
Comedy!

156
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,358
Cue Miss Swedenbabe.

157
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,359
So let's meet our first contestant.

158
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,399
Miss Swedenbaby!

159
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
This is why I didn't want you here.

160
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,160
What's that?

161
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,559
Miss Englandbabe is where?

162
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,599
She's been clamped?

163
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Well, tell her to get a taxi, then.

164
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,479
She won't leave her Porsche?

165
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,238
I'll come and get her.

166
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,239
Who's going to do this?

167
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Listen to me.

168
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,239
You have one simple job.

169
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,240
You must tell Hector who each girl is.

170
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,960
Their names are on these cards. Got it?

171
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:18,319
Do not mess it up.

172
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Who? Me?

173
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,159
Thank you, Miss Swedenbaby!

174
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,878
Miss Finlandbabe!

175
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,879
Miss Finlandbaby!

176
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,919
Well, good luck with the elephants.

177
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,999
Thank you, Miss Finlandbaby.

178
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Miss Spainbabe!

179
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Miss Spainbaby!

180
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,358
You are not Miss Spainbaby.

181
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,359
So, Miss Italybaby,

182
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,159
it says here that your hobbies
are children and animals.

183
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,278
Fascinating.

184
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,518
Yes! It's your favourite traffic warden.

185
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,278
It's...me!

186
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,279
I passed!

187
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,759
Where is everybody?

188
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,318
The Eurobabe Contest.

189
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,319
Well, good luck with the dolphins.

190
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Thank you, Miss Italybaby.

191
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Miss Hungarybaby!

192
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:46,239
Are you Hungary? Are you Hungary?

193
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,079
You are not Miss Hungarybaby.

194
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,119
So welcome, Miss...oh, no.

195
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,560
-  How's it going?
-  Very well. No problems.

196
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:19,599
She's a bit emotional, I think.

197
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,558
We've got big problems.

198
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,559
Miss Englandbabe will not come here.

199
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:56,399
-  She's broken a nail.
-  Nasty.

200
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,639
But we've got to have
a Miss Englandbabe. We are in London.

201
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Yes, Eunice? Right away, Eunice.

202
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,278
Eunice wants to see me. Now.

203
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,279
Think of something, Nick, and fast.

204
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:15,399
..eager to wear
the Channel Nine Eurobaby Crown.

205
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:18,719
Miss Englandbabe is where?

206
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,278
Miss Spainbabe!

207
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,839
Think of something, Nick, and fast.

208
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,438
She's a bit emotional, I think.

209
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:28,278
-  She's broken a nail.
-  Nasty.

210
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,038
And we come to our last contestant

211
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,039
in this fantastic Eurobaby Contest.

212
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,839
Last but not least, it is...

213
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,599
It is...

214
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:49,119
Of course!

215
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,599
It is Miss Englandbaby!

216
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,958
Welcome, Miss England...

217
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,799
-  Welcome.
-  Thank you. Thank you.

218
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Well, let's find out about you.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You like pizzas...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
rock 'n' roll and motorbikes.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My kind of girl!

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And dancing with women.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you mean men. Dancing with...

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nick!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said you needed
a Miss Englandbaby fast.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I meant a woman.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  Nice legs, Nick.
-  Thanks, Annie.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  Hi, Annie.
-  Thank you, Miss Englandbaby.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And next, we find out why our babies

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
want to represent their country.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There are beautiful women everywhere.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know!

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Miss Englandbabe is still missing.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are we going to do?

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eunice said she'll fire me
if I don't find someone.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, no! No.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bingo!

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear we have a replacement
for our last contestant.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It is the new Miss Englandbaby!

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So tell me, Miss Englandbaby...

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
why do you want
to represent your country?

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to represent England

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
because I care
about the environment, pollution.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I care about people.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I have great legs.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the winner of the Channel Nine
Eurobaby Contest is...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Miss Englandbaby!

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations, Annie! You did it!

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You are the most beautiful
traffic warden in Europe!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Next time in Extra...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nick gets a job in a kung fu movie.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bridget nearly loses her job.
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what happens
when Annie meets a new man?
