00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,720
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:22,159
and the boys next door,
Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,078
Annie and Hector want to be together.

4
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:29,359
Bridget wants to meet a new man.

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,559
And Nick wants to be rich and famous.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,560
Stand by for Extra.

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,119
Charley, look at that.

8
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,399
Hola, Charley.

9
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:17,119
What's wrong?

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,198
Shaving cream!

11
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:26,199
Whipping cream!

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Hector.

13
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,119
Next time you go shopping...

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,120
kitchen, bathroom, OK?

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Bathroom, kitchen, got it.

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,398
What are you watching?

17
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,399
It's a dog show.

18
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,598
I like that!

19
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,599
I didn't know you liked dogs.

20
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,399
I don't like dogs.

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,199
I like those women with their dogs.

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Charley likes the dogs.

23
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,719
The lady dogs.

24
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,759
You can enter the dog show this year
and win two thousand pounds.

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
What?

26
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,999
Hector, slap me.

27
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Thanks.

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,680
How much did she say?

29
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,519
Two thousand pounds.

30
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,718
We must enter this dog show with Charley.

31
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,438
All right, let's do it.

32
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,439
Yes!

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,679
Oh, no!

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,278
Hello. Earth to Bridget.

35
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,598
Earth to Bridget.

36
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,079
Bridget!

37
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,080
What are you looking for?

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,198
My new T- shirt.
I'm meeting my boyfriend...

39
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,199
What boyfriend?

40
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:54,079
My new boyfriend.

41
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,879
Tell me everything.

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,639
Well...

43
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,640
his name's Philip, he's very elegant and...

44
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:11,559
Annie, we've had a really...

45
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,119
good...idea!

46
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,959
Wait.

47
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,599
Careful.

48
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:32,719
We've just seen a dog show on TV.

49
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,479
Yes, that's right.

50
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,999
A really good dog show.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you like dog shows, Annie?

52
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,078
I...

53
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,079
hate them!

54
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,199
They are cruel.

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,759
Not all dog shows, Annie.

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,760
Yes, Nick, all dog shows.

57
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,880
They are... They are...horrible.

58
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,319
You have to respect animals.

59
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,399
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,678
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You are so right, Annie.

61
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,719
So what shall we do?

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,639
We will have to train Charley ourselves,

63
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,038
without Annie knowing.

64
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,039
Hey.

65
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:31,559
Hey.

66
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,119
Forget that.

67
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,120
Read this.

68
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,358
What? 'How to train your dog'.

69
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:43,278
Now we can train Charley.

70
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,279
Charley. Here, boy.

71
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,559
Sit.

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Sit!

73
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Good dog.

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Good trainer.

75
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Charley's not there.

76
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,279
Charley's not there?

77
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Annie has taken him to the vet.

78
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,398
-  The vet?
-  The vet. The animal doctor.

79
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,358
Well, we can still start training.

80
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:28,359
We can? How?

81
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Sit!

82
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,439
I said 'sit'.

83
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:42,559
Sit.

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,159
Good boy, good boy.

85
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Now roll over.

86
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,959
Roll over.

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Good doggie, Charley.

88
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,079
Roll over.

89
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,479
Roll over, Hector.

90
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Good boy!

91
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Good boy, Hector. Good boy.

92
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,639
Now, now, I...

93
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,640
-  I want to be the dog.
-  No, no, I am the dog.

94
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,958
I want...

95
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,959
-  I don't know these people!
-  Hi, Bridget.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, they're not my friends.

97
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,079
What are they doing?

98
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Well, you've heard of yoga?

99
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,999
Yes.

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, this is a new type of yoga -  dog yoga.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, dog yoga.

102
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,199
Do- ga.

103
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:22,239
Fantastic!

104
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,678
Come on, Bridget,
introduce me to these spiritual boys.

105
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,278
Philip.

106
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,279
Hector and Nick.

107
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Hiya.

108
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Are dogs allowed on the sofa?

109
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Maybe we should eat out.

110
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:14,599
Come on, Philip.

111
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,959
I don't like that man.

112
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,160
I don't think he likes you either.

113
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:47,479
Was that Bridget's new boyfriend?

114
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,559
Yep.

115
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,079
That's right, Charley, he's a bad man.

116
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Top dog.

117
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,800
-  Tell me everything.
-  Well...

118
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:38,239
-  Let's do it!
-  Yes!

119
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,278
Fantastic!

120
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,799
That's right, Charley, he's a bad man.

121
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Come on, Charley.

122
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Wait.

123
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,279
Where are you taking him?

124
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,280
For a walk.

125
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,519
Time to train Charley.

126
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Let me take him.

127
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:26,239
-  You'll take him for his walk?
-  Yeah.

128
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,479
OK.

129
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Where's the kettle?

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Bridget.

131
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,880
I'll buy Charley a nice ribbon,

132
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,920
then the lady dogs will love him.

133
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,799
Hey, Charley. Come on, walkies!

134
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Hey, Nick. Catch!

135
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Bridget, that's my Walkman.

136
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,919
Well, you take my things.

137
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:12,639
I don't take your things.

138
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Yes, you do.

139
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,879
Where's my necklace, then?

140
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,319
I haven't got your necklace.

141
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Well, I think you have. And my photo frame.

142
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,920
I haven't got your photo frame.

143
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:40,319
-  Yes, you have.
-  No, I haven't!

144
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,278
-  Yes, you have!
-  No, I haven't!

145
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,279
Yes, you have!

146
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Girls, girls, please.

147
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,439
Don't touch my things.

148
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Hello, hello.

149
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,598
I didn't touch your things.

150
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:10,599
Sit!

151
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:27,238
Annie is so angry.

152
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,239
What have you done?

153
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Me? Nothing.

154
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,359
She has been fighting with Bridget.

155
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,398
The girls have been fighting. I missed it.

156
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,399
Anyway, how was your walk with Charley?
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

157
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,079
Great.

158
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Women love Charley.

159
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Nick, what a handsome dog you have.

160
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:08,319
Look, I've brought him a ribbon for the show.

161
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,638
-  And where is he?
-  Where is who?

162
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,639
Charley, the dog.

163
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,279
Stay there, good boy.

164
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,238
A quick pint.

165
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:48,239
'You are too cruel to own a dog.

166
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,599
'He is safe with me.'

167
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,798
But he was only tied up
at that lamppost for...

168
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:14,799
..a bit.

169
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,680
What's going on?

170
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,880
It's called...

171
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,599
Dog yoga.

172
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Very nice.

173
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Oh, no. Not dog yoga again.

174
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Talking of dogs, where is Charley?

175
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,680
-  He's asleep.
-  He's ill.

176
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,758
-  He's having his hair cut.
-  He's busy.

177
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,759
So he's asleep and ill and busy,

178
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,880
and having his hair cut?

179
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,878
Yeah.

180
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,359
OK.

181
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,758
We have to get Charley back!

182
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,159
Good boy.

183
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,160
Good boy, good boy.

184
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,278
Where is Charley?

185
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,279
-  He's asleep.
-  He's ill.

186
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,240
-  Having his hair cut.
-  He's busy.

187
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,119
I didn't touch your things!

188
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,519
Where's my necklace, then?

189
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:20,479
Nick.

190
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Hector, hey.

191
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Don't worry, I've found him.

192
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,640
-  I've found him!
-  Great!

193
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,680
The other phone is ringing.
See you later. Bye.

194
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Yeah!

195
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,038
Hello?

196
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,278
Police?

197
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,279
What?

198
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,638
You found our dog!

199
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:09,639
Great, thanks very much.

200
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,519
Bye.

201
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,920
But...

202
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:24,879
if the police have found our dog...

203
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,639
whose dog has Nick found?

204
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Sorry. I'm sorry.

205
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,359
Look, I'm sorry. I thought it was mine!

206
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:45,479
Up, up, up.

207
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:37,879
Good dog. Up... Don't...

208
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,438
Hello.

209
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:45,439
Nick, where are you?

210
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,558
The police station?

211
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,559
You took a dog from an old woman?

212
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,119
Nick, how could you?

213
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:29,879
OK.

214
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,118
OK.

215
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,079
I am coming.

216
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,080
That woman, she really went for you
and she was old!

217
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,839
I thought she was Mike Tyson's mother.

218
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,038
We must go, the dog show.

219
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,119
Hi, guys.

220
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,759
Hi, Charley.

221
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Why are you wearing that?

222
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
We were taking photographs.

223
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,839
-  Were we?
-  Yes.

224
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
-  Taking photographs?
-  Yes.

225
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:18,319
I'm meeting Philip tonight
and I can't find my earrings.

226
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:21,759
Come on, they must be somewhere.

227
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,118
You.

228
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,119
You've stolen them.

229
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,279
I told you, I haven't stolen anything.

230
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,760
-  Yes, you have. You're a thief!
-  I am not a thief! I'm...

231
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,880
Whoa, ladies, no fighting here.

232
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Break it up!

233
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,239
Where's the fridge?

234
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,919
-  Hello and welcome to Croft's Dog Show.
-  Bridget!

235
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,478
A dog show, how stupid.

236
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:06,479
Where is the fridge?

237
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Where's Charley?

238
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,519
Charley!

239
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:19,999
Charley.

240
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,239
Charley and the fridge have gone.

241
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,679
Charley has taken the fridge!

242
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,599
Well, it will be a great day here at Croft's,
this annual event...

243
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Charley?

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
..with the culmination of months of work
for dog owners everywhere.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These dogs are trained to the highest standards
and are a credit to their owners.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It looks hopeful.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, yes.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It looks very hopeful. Look at her!

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look after Charley.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, hello there.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, there's Hector and Charley.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And there's Nick!

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's that woman?

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a very big dog.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That really is a big dog.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, I know.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your attention, please. The dog show winner is...

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Charley, with his trainers Hector and Nick.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've won, we've won!

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two thousand pounds!

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks, Annie.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you hate dog shows.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, if Charley wins, then that's different.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you won two thousand pounds.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, not exactly.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We won two thousand pounds
to spend in Dog's Heaven.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is great.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Smells nice and...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
gets rid of fleas.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm ready, Philip.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bridget.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look nice.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're going out for dinner,
a very romantic dinner.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You stupid dog, get off me!

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Charley, stop it!

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  What is he doing?
-  Get off him!

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My scarf!

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My jewellery.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My photo frame and more!

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Philip, you've been stealing our things.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're the thief.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I...

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I...

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get him, Charley!

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Charley, Charley, Charley.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a thief!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your boyfriend is a thief.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, who can blame him?

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He took souvenirs

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
to remind him of me.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So romantic.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Next time in Extra...

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Annie is a hypnotist.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nick and Hector are party entertainers.
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But what happens
when they lose the birthday girl?
