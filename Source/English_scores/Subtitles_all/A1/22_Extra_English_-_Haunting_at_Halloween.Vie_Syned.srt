00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
This is the story of Bridget
and Annie, who share a flat in London

2
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,839
and the boys next door -
Nick, and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,278
Hector and Annie
still love each other.

4
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,798
Bridget still loves herself.
[Welcome to www.24hmedia.net]

5
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:32,799
And Nick loves babes,
motorbikes and pizza.

6
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,319
Stand by for Extra.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,320
And I can see
a great big bowl of dog food.

8
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:12,079
And on the bowl, it says a name.

9
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,199
It says...

10
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,479
'Charley'!

11
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,119
It must be teatime, Charley.

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Guess what!

13
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,120
You've just met Brad Pitt.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What? Don't be ridiculous, Annie.

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,198
I've just been to see Rose Marie.

16
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:52,199
-  Who's Rose Marie?
-  My fortune teller.

17
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,159
And she says I'm going to meet
a tall, dark, handsome stranger.

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Oooh! When?

19
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,039
She didn't say.

20
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,759
-  Where?
-  She didn't say.

21
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,918
It must be true then.

22
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:09,718
Maybe I'll meet him
at tonight's Halloween party.

23
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,719
Have you read
your horoscopes for today?

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,878
-  No.
-  Read mine.

25
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,879
Aquarius, Libra, Leo...

26
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,038
Ah, Taurus -  the Bull.

27
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,478
'Taurus -  today,
you will be in for a big surprise.'

28
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,479
Ooh, goody.

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,760
I'm getting a name...

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,479
It's...Nick.

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,480
Gigi, you must be psychic.

32
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,599
-  Sidekick?
-  No.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,638
Not 'sidekick', 'psychic'.
A fortune- teller.

34
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,639
Someone who can see the future.

35
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,559
Ah, like Nostradamus?

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,958
-  Who?
-  Kind of.

37
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,718
Like horoscopes, or tarot.

38
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,878
The tarot. The Death card.

39
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,879
Look, it's Bridget with no make- up.

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,598
Like...
having the palm of your hand read.

41
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,478
Ah, rubbish! There's nothing there.

42
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,479
What a surprise!

43
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,318
Come here, give me your hand.

44
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,319
I'll give you a lesson.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,759
This one is your life line.

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,760
-  This one is your love line.
-  Oh, yes?

47
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,158
And this one is your...punch line!

48
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,159
Punch line?

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,999
She means it's the end of my lesson.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hey, Hector.

51
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:41,279
What happens when you go
to a fortune- teller's house?

52
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,159
Come in!

53
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Ha ha!

54
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,519
Let's see what your horoscope says.

55
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,919
You don't believe all that rubbish?

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Rose Marie says Bridget is going to
meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger.

57
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,838
Hector...

58
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,318
Bridget, this is my tall, dark,
handsome stranger. Get your own!

59
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,319
-  Who is Rose Marie?
-  My fortune- teller.

60
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,399
Is she good- looking?
Could she find me a cute babe?

61
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,400
-  Do you want to hear your horoscope?
-  Go on then. Aquarius.

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,518
Aquarius, eh? I should've guessed.

63
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,519
'This week, beware of black hair

64
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,040
and the number three.'

65
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,759
That means that three babes with
black hair are going to chase me.

66
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,760
-  Spooky!
-  Can I be Aquarius?

67
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,878
-  No!
-  Come on, Hector, let's go out.

68
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,879
I'm going to meet
some black- haired babes.

69
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,718
Put that umbrella down -
it's very unlucky.

70
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:27,719
But I'm feeling lucky.

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,200
I wish I could meet
a tall, dark, handsome stranger.

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Well, let me look into my crystal ball.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Annie, that's a goldfish bowl.

74
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,238
So? I got it right for Charley.
Didn't I, Charley?

75
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:47,719
That could be my stranger now.

76
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,678
Hello, Bernard.

77
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:52,679
Hello, Bernard. How are you?

78
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,279
Not happy, not happy at all.

79
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,438
I've lost my Marbles.

80
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,439
Oh, dear, Bernard's lost his marbles.

81
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,439
What?

82
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,440
You mean Marbles your cat?

83
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:14,199
And she's not well -
she's got a cold.

84
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,399
Oh, well, I'm sure you'll find her.

85
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,998
We'll look out for her, Bernard.

86
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,399
I hope so. Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Poor Bernard.

88
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,398
He's lost his marbles.

89
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,399
It had to happen.

90
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,198
And on the bowl, it says a name.

91
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,199
It says...Charley!

92
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Hello, Bernard.

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,518
Oh, dear, Bernard's lost his marbles.

94
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,519
You don't believe all that rubbish, do you?

95
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,519
..are going to chase me.

96
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Spooky!

97
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,279
I'm feeling lucky!

98
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:47,679
This is a true story about
a man and wife on their honeymoon.

99
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:52,559
They were in the car, it was late.

100
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,959
The wife broke her mirror,
which means seven years bad luck.

101
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Just then, they ran out of petrol.

102
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,559
So, the man told the wife
to go for petrol.

103
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,560
He's the man, he should've gone.

104
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,959
Equal opportunities.

105
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
The wife was gone for a long time.

106
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,799
Then...

107
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,919
He heard a noise
on the roof of the car.

108
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,279
It got louder.

109
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,280
And then...

110
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,679
his wife appeared.

111
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,959
She smiled and walked away.

112
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
The noise was very loud.

113
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,398
The man got out of his car
and standing on the roof, he saw...

114
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,399
a madman holding his wife's head!

115
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:53,998
So, the banging was...

116
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,999
..her head?

117
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,159
But he'd just seen his wife.

118
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,719
That...

119
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,840
was her ghost.

120
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Is that a true story?

121
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,919
Yeah.

122
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,799
-  Tell us another.
-  No, don't.

123
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
I mean, it was a bit dull, wasn't it?

124
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:33,199
Come on,
let's go shopping for the party.

125
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,519
Yeah, I'm in the mood now.

126
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,319
Are you coming, Nick?

127
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,319
No. See you later.

128
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,320
One, two...

129
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,438
-  Beware of black hair...
-  Three apples.

130
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:51,439
..and the number three.

131
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,639
So what? There are three apples.

132
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:00,318
Big deal.

133
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,998
Seven years of bad luck...

134
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:04,999
What rubbish!

135
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:09,199
I think I'll go back to my apartment now.

136
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Black cat...black hair.

137
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,599
Right, keep calm.

138
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Nice pussy.

139
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,039
Who's there?

140
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,479
Number...number three.

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Stop!

142
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,599
Nick? Nick? Nick?

143
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
He's coming round.

144
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,279
What's going on?
Why are you dressed like that?

145
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Nick, have you forgotten?

146
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,440
It's Halloween.
We're going to the party.

147
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Oh, yeah.

148
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,679
I cannot get this knife
into the pumpkin. Can you...?

149
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,439
Yeah.

150
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,399
Trick or treat?

151
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,680
Treat.

152
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,959
There you are.

153
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Thank you.

154
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,718
-  Aren't they sweet?
-  Yeah.

155
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:40,159
Sweet.

-  I think the small one fancied you.
-  You think so?

Boys, they weren't pretending.

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,998
A power cut!

167
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,999
What was that?

168
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,038
Who was that?

169
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,039
Bernard,
what are you doing on the roof?

170
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
I still can't find my Marbles.

171
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,159
-  Your marbles?
-  His cat.

172
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Bernard, I really don't think
that you should be on the roof.

173
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,158
Bernard, are you OK?

174
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,159
Yeah, fine.
I'll kill that cat when I find it.

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I know, we'll light a candle.

176
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:56,479
Well, there's no television,
so I guess it's time for bed.

177
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,719
Oh, no!

178
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
What's the matter, boys?
Are you scared of the dark?

179
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,679
No.

180
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Well, if you're not scared
of the dark, then let's play a game.

181
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,959
-  A game?
-  Let's get the ouija board out.

182
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
B -  that's you, Bridget.

183
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,799
Fan- ci- es...

184
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,118
N -  that's you, Nick.

185
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:57,119
Bridget fancies Nick!

186
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Don't be so childish.
Give that to me.

187
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,039
It's getting warm. I can feel...

188
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
It's starting to move.

189
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,078
H -  that's you, Hector.

190
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,199
Depart. But I am not leaving.

191
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,038
Depart.

192
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,039
'Dearly departed' means dead.

193
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,038
That's it, I am leaving.

194
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,039
Hector, sit down!

195
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
-  You are moving the glass, Bridget.
-  No, I'm not.

196
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,639
N -  I think it's for you, Nick.

197
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Oh, great, it'll be about babes.

198
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Three what?

199
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,199
Didn't your horoscope say,
'Beware of the number three?'

200
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,879
Oh, yeah.

201
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,079
You don't believe
that rubbish, do you?

202
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,879
Of course I do. Don't you?

203
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Well, the lights are back on.

204
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,279
I'm tired.

205
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:48,439
Why don't you depart then?

206
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,239
Great idea.
Come on, Hector, let's go.

207
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,039
-  Hector?
-  Eh?

208
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Do you believe in horoscopes?

209
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,640
-  Of course not.
-  No, of course not.

210
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,478
They're silly.

211
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:08,479
'Beware of black hair
and the number three.'

212
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,840
-  Rubbish!
-  Yeah.

213
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,840
It could've meant, 'Beware of those
three witches we met at the party.'

214
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,759
Well, they did have black hair.

215
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Or those three trick or treaters.

216
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Trick or treat?

217
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,319
Or the black cat.

218
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,239
-  What was that noise?
-  Probably the wind.

219
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Yeah, the wind.

220
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,038
-  Hector?
-  Eh?

221
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,039
Can I get into your bed?

222
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,880
OK.

223
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,679
-  I'm not afraid of the dark.
-  Nor am I.

224
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,680
I've only got one torch -
it's good to share.

225
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:01,399
The storm's finished.

226
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,040
What's that noise?

227
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,119
It's in the room.

228
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,680
It's getting nearer.

229
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:28,278
-  Who's that?
-  I don't know.

230
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,279
Nick, there is something
touching my legs.

231
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:40,999
-  Well, it's not me.
-  I know.

232
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:44,479
But there is something
touching my legs.

233
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Bernard, did you hear that scream?

234
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,399
What are you doing?

235
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,399
I think Marbles is in there.

236
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Right, we're going in.

237
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,640
Hector, Nick? What's the matter?

238
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,518
Marbles, there you are!

239
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,158
How's your cold?

240
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,159
Are you two OK?

241
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,320
What's wrong?

242
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,718
Has the cat got your tongue?

243
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:46,399
Next time in Extra::

244
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Nick goes shopping.

245
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,118
Hector tells Annie the truth.
