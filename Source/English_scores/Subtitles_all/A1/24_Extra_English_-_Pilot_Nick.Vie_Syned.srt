00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,799
Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,160
One for the party
and one for the party hostess.

9
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,358
One for the party
and one for the party...

10
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,359
accountant.

11
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Hey, it's Builder Barbie!

12
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,479
Very funny.

13
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,239
Eunice wants some building work done

14
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,078
and guess who has to organise it.

15
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,319
Builder Barbie?

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,320
Hey, not for you, for the party.

17
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,119
We're having a party?
What shall I wear?

18
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,359
It's a street party.

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,360
We're having a party in the street
to protest and stop the cars.

20
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,718
Nice!

21
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,719
Hey, what's this?

22
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,519
Don't touch it.
It belonged to my grandmother.

23
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,599
Your grandmother? It's lovely.

24
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Yes. It's very special to me.

25
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,959
Well, what do you think?

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,198
Captain Chip Hardy,
Pilot Extraordinaire.

27
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,199
Nick, is that you?

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,958
It can't be.

29
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,079
Women love uniforms.

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Hey, hey,
Builder Barbie and Pilot Ken!

31
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,479
But why are you dressed like a pilot?

32
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
I am in a play -

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Chip Hardy, Pilot Extraordinaire -

34
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,039
for a theatre festival in Paris.

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Now, who is going
to help me rehearse?

36
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,038
Sorry, got to go.

37
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,559
Come on, you know you want to.

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,560
-  Come fly with me.
-  What?

39
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,278
Oh, yes, Chip, I thought
about you all the time.

40
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,279
-  Nick, I really think...
-  Don't tell me, I feel it too -

41
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,879
something's not quite right.

42
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,838
I have got it.

43
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,839
Here. There. Beautiful.
Now, I can fancy you.

44
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,839
Oh, no, Nick, please.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Did you miss me, sweet thing?

46
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:10,998
Oh, yes, Chip, I thought
about you all the time.

47
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:13,999
When we get to Barbados...

48
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:21,439
Sorry.

49
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,920
But now, we have work to do.

50
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,640
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
your captain Chip Hardy speaking.

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,560
We will now go through
the safety routine.

52
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:45,279
Exits are here, here and here.

53
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,840
In the event of cabin decompression,

54
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,319
place oxygen masks
over your face, like so.

55
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,720
But please, attend to your own mask
before helping children.

56
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,959
Life jackets can be found
under your seat.

57
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,999
In case of forced landing,
adopt the following position.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Eunice,

59
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,120
-  I've got the builders on the phone.
-  About time.

60
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,959
Hello. You can start today?

61
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,960
Oh, Jean- Pierre,
how nice to hear from you.

62
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:27,599
We really need the job done quickly.

63
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,798
We should meet tonight? Oh, yes.

64
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:33,799
Ah, yes, where to start?

65
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,319
Where? Mm,
that's a very good question.

66
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Where would you like
the building work to start?

67
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,240
I was thinking...in my flat.

68
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,120
-  In your flat?
-  Oh, yes. In my flat.

69
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:16,239
Hello? We want you
to start work in Eunice's flat.

70
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Yes, that's right, in Eunice's flat.

71
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:33,679
-  It's 31 Evergreen Street.
-  It's 31 Evergreen Street.

72
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,760
That's right. Bye.

73
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,758
-  Tea? Coffee?
-  No, no, no!

74
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,519
Make it musical, feel the words.

75
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Tea! Or coffee!

76
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,078
Tea! Or coffee!

77
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,839
Thanks.

78
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Hey, Nick, do women really
go for you in that uniform?

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah.

80
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,318
But do they know
that you are not a real pilot?

81
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,319
Well...

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You tell them you are a real pilot?

83
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,599
Maybe.

84
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,878
Hello? Captain Chip Hardy speaking.

85
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,879
Oh, hi, Tiffany.

86
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,840
I love this uniform!

87
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,799
Yes, that's right, sweetie.

88
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,039
Currently flying at 20,000 feet,
heading for Barbados.

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes, that's right, darling,
above the clouds, above the clouds.

90
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Mayday, mayday...

91
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,680
No, no, no, we're just...

92
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,918
We're not being attacked,
it's just a bit of turbulence.

93
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,919
Look, I've got to go. Bye- bye.

94
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,760
-  Hi, Eunice.
-  Guess where this came from.

95
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,440
-  DIY shop?
-  No. From my flat.

96
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,919
Ah, yes. Have the builders started?
Excellent.

97
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Excellent? Excellent?!
My flat is a mess.

98
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
You told the builders
to work in my flat?

99
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,159
Yes, you said.

100
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,160
But the builders were supposed
to work at Channel 9.

101
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,719
Your mistake, you fix it.

102
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,319
-  But you...
-  And until you do,

103
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,919
I'm going to stay in your flat.

104
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,398
We want you to start work
in Eunice's flat.

105
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,399
Yes, that's right, in Eunice's flat.

106
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Captain Chip Hardy,
Pilot Extraordinaire.

107
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,878
I want to ride the pony!

108
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,879
Bridget, I want my breakfast now.

109
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:04,439
Of course.

110
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:09,719
-  What would you like?
-  I want...

111
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,919
fresh coconut milk,
two rashers of crisp bacon,

112
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,920
preserve of morello cherries -
on French toast -

113
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,879
and coffee -  Italian coffee.

114
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Fresh coconut milk, Italian coffee?

115
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,239
-  I don't have...
-  So, go out and buy them for me.

116
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,959
Horrible!

117
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Captain Hardy,
what are we going to do?

118
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,879
It will be OK.

119
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:01,599
I am too young to die.

120
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,840
-  You have to save us.
-  Try to be calm.

121
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:08,638
But what about my family?
What about my cat?

122
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,839
Pull yourself together, woman.

123
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Excellent! You're really good.
That was like...

124
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Catherine Zeta- Jones.

125
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:25,319
You didn't have to slap me for real.

126
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:28,359
Sorry, but I...

127
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,880
Hello? Captain Chip Hardy speaking.

128
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,519
What?

129
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,959
It's the director.

130
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,959
What? What?!

131
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Just a minute.

132
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:15,479
The actress? She's ill?

133
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,879
But we must still do the play.

134
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,078
No, we don't have much time.

135
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,079
Don't worry, I know the perfect
person to play the part.

136
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:44,439
Oh, yes, the perfect person. Bye.

137
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,560
I...have an extra ticket for Paris.

138
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,239
-  Do you want to come with me?
-  Paris?

139
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:04,279
-  Oui, oui.
-  Excellente!

140
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,280
You call this a breakfast?

141
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:12,119
That's what I think of this.

142
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,358
And this.

143
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:32,759
And this.

144
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,760
And I have a little washing for you.

145
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,799
In the bedroom.

146
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,759
Now, what shall I eat?

147
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,760
You call this, 'a little washing?'

148
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:54,119
Be quiet and do it.

149
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:11,399
Hi. I got some polish
for Granny's chest.

150
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,759
-  Nice.
-  Oh, I love it so much.

151
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,760
It really reminds me of her.

152
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,159
Hey, you're eating my party food.

153
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Yes, but...

154
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,039
it's not very good.
Here, Charley boy!

155
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Annie, Annie, please.

156
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,960
I don't want to lose my job.
It's only for a few days.

157
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,360
Now, which of you lucky girls
is going to cut my toenails?

158
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,279
I'm going to kill that woman!

159
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,559
No, no, let me.

160
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,479
Are you having fun with Eunice?

161
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,480
Why don't you stay here
while we are away?

162
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,639
No, thank you.

163
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Good luck in Paris.

164
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,640
Oh, Paris, c'est magnifique!

165
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,680
Hector, where were you?
Our play starts soon.

166
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,759
OK, good luck.

167
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Hector, there's something
I've got to tell you.

168
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,718
Your play, it starts very soon.

169
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,719
Where is the actress
who plays the stewardess?

170
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Well, actually she's right here.

171
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,759
Good joke.

172
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,360
The actress, she's ill.
[Welcome to www.24hmedia.net]

173
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
You are going to play the stewardess.

174
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:43,199
Look, there's your costume.

175
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,479
You are not serious?

176
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,840
You are serious.

177
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Listen, Sylvia,
I am going to fly this plane,

178
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,519
I will need all my crew.
You are a professional.

179
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:14,199
I am your captain.

180
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,079
Will you fly with me?

181
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No, no. No, no, no.

182
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,399
I am not doing it.

183
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Sylvia, I'm proud of you.

184
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Oh, shut up.

185
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,720
What's that?

186
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,678
-  Come and have something to eat.
-  The shape looks familiar.

187
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:57,679
You've guessed.

188
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,919
It is that chest.

189
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,959
I did some work on it for you.

190
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,960
It looked so boring.
I gave it a whole new look.

191
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,598
My grandmother's chest!

192
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,318
Annie, Annie, please.

193
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:30,319
Annie, Annie, please.

194
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,478
Where is the actress
who plays the stewardess?

195
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:39,479
Well, she's ill.

196
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
You are going to play the stewardess.

197
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Oh, shut up.

198
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,279
That was close!
We nearly missed the plane.

199
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Look at the reviews.

200
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,359
'Irresistible.'

201
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,319
'Dazzling.'

202
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:28,479
And that was just her legs.

203
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,960
'The hostess was beautiful...

204
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
in a masculine way.'

205
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,559
What's going on?

206
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:50,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're experiencing some turbulence.

207
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:59,279
There's nothing to worry about except
that the pilot and co- pilot are ill.

208
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Does anybody know how to fly a plane?

209
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,319
Don't worry, I will fly this plane.

210
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,039
Nick, you cannot fly this plane.

211
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,040
I am Captain Chip Hardy.

212
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:16,959
I can do anything.

213
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,518
You are just an actor.

214
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,519
Captain Chip Hardy is your character.

215
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:28,399
But I have the heart of a pilot.

216
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Tea? Coffee?

217
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Wait a minute.

218
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,119
Hello?

219
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:47,239
Oh, really? Oh, excellent!

220
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:50,479
Goodbye.

221
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,679
Who was that?

222
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,159
The builders.
Eunice's flat is finished!

223
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Really?

224
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Her flat is ready!

225
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,878
Our flat is ours again!

226
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,518
Hello, girls.
Have you had a nice time?

227
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,519
What happened here?

228
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,558
Just a little party.

229
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,559
It was really fun.

230
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,719
OK, Eunice,

231
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,720
we've spoken to the builders.

232
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:46,479
Your flat's ready.

233
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:53,439
You can go home now.

234
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,958
I like it here.

235
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,839
I think I'm going to stay.

236
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,840
Where's my cocktail?

237
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,319
Bring my new wig.

238
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,880
-  What do you mean?
-  What do I mean?

239
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,799
I am going to stay.

240
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,839
We are back!

241
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,840
Paris was great and...

242
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:34,479
Pilot Ken and Stewardess Barbie.

243
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,040
But he really is a pilot -
he flew the plane!

244
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Well, for a moment.
Till the co- pilot punched me.

245
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,118
What happened here? A hurricane?

246
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,278
Yes, something like that.

247
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,158
Well, Nick, what's this? A new job?

248
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,158
Yes, sort of.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, Mr Pilot, shall we have some fun?

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, OK.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will you take me flying?

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OK.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall we stay here or go to my place?

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go to your place.
This place is a mess!

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really, girls,
you should tidy up a bit.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It is the uniform.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At last, she's gone!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm exhausted.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, if you are tired, can I
offer you some tea or coffee?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Next time in Extra -

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bridget is interested in modern art,

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Annie is fighting
to free farm animals,

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and who else is coming to dinner?
