00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:17,159
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,120
and the boys next door,
Nick, and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
Bridget and Hector work for Channel 9.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Annie works for the environment.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,520
And Nick works as little as possible.

6
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,159
Stand by for Extra.

7
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,520
It's Friday, it's seven o'clock.

8
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,759
Yes, it's time for an evening with Marty Ross.

9
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,879
And here's Marty!

10
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,239
Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
Let's spend this evening together.

11
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:33,919
Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
Let's spend this evening together.

12
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
Let's spend this afternoon together.

13
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,359
Marty! Hi.

14
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,559
I was just writing notes for your show.

15
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,159
You like what you see?

16
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Marty, you're so funny.

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,479
Is Lady Macbeth in?

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,960
-  Who?
-  The dragon. Eunice.

19
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:21,359
No.

20
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,838
Marty, you're so funny.

21
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,839
Has Eunice got me tickets
for Damian Pollasco's latest exhibition yet?

22
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,798
Who?

23
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,799
Damian Pollasco.
The most important artist this century.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,120
He's so raw,

25
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,239
so angry.

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Of course he is. Silly me. I forgot.

27
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,359
Good old Damian.

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Anyone who is anyone
will be there tomorrow night.

29
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,919
So of course I must be there.

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,118
Yes.

31
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:11,119
So tell the dragon if there are no tickets,
I will not present Saturday's show.

32
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,760
But you must, Marty. You're the star.

33
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
But if there are tickets,
then I will take her out to dinner.

34
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,039
In fact, I'll take anyone out to dinner
who gets me those tickets.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Anyway, must go. I've got fans to ignore.

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Well? Carry on.

37
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,879
Hi, darling, Marty Ross here.
Let's spend this evening together.

38
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,239
What a professional.

39
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,360
So if I get tickets for Damian Pollasco,

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
I get dinner with Marty Ross!

41
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,598
Who do I know? Who do I know?

42
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,599
I know! Dave! He's crazy about me.

43
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,719
Hi, Dave. It's Bridget.

44
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,639
I've got a little favour to ask you.

45
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Is anybody home?

46
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:05,159
Annie, is that you?

47
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,679
Is that Ziggy? I think you should let her out.

48
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,480
No, it's OK. We're seeing
what it's like to be a battery chicken.

49
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,359
A chicken that runs on batteries?

50
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,479
-  No.
-  No!

51
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
A chicken that is kept in a small box
to lay her eggs. Poor thing.

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,438
But isn't Ziggy a bit...

53
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,439
No. It makes it more real, doesn't it, Ziggy?

54
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,079
Tomorrow there is a big Farm Animal
Freedom Protest in Trafalgar Square

55
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,318
and we will be demonstrating.

56
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,319
-  Demonstrating what?
-  What it's like to be a farm animal.

57
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,879
Sounds exciting.

58
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Boggy and Moss are coming from Manchester.

59
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,599
Boggy and Moss?

60
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Boggy and Moss
are very, very serious eco- warriors.

61
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,479
Eco- warriors?

62
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,480
They fight for the environment.

63
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
And you two will help us prepare.

64
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,559
Won't you, boys?

65
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,439
Bye.

66
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Good old Dave. I knew he'd help me.

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,320
He just can't resist me.

68
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,319
Now...Marty.

69
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,079
Hi.

70
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Hi, Marty. It's Gigi.

71
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,439
-  Gigi?
-  Bridget.

72
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
-  Bridget who?
-  Bridget. Eunice's researcher.

73
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,840
-  Have we met?
-  Well, only about one hundred times.

74
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Listen, I've got two preview tickets
for Damian Pollasco.

75
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,919
Oh, that Bridget. How could I forget you?

76
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,199
How about meeting for drinks
at your place first?

77
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,120
I'd...love to...

78
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
but it's just a simple loft- style apartment.

79
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,598
Well, I'm sure it's very arty.

80
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,599
I can tell a lot about a woman from her art.

81
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,199
They call me Arty Marty, you know.

82
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
And if I like your art, Bridget,
maybe dinner afterwards?

83
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,559
Marty! What a surprise! I'd love to.

84
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,039
See you tomorrow, baby.

85
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,960
-  Bye.
-  Ciao.

86
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,959
Dinner with Marty,
dinner with Marty, dinner with Marty!

87
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,758
What shall I wear?

88
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,959
My flat! Arty?

89
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,078
Annie, look at this flat.

90
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,959
Sorry, Bridget.

91
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Right, I've got 24 hours.

92
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,280
-  I think you should let her out.
-  No, it's OK.

93
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Boggy and Moss
are very, very serious eco- warriors.

94
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,760
And you two will help us prepare.

95
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
I've got two preview tickets for Damian Pollasco.

96
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,280
They call me Arty Marty, you know.

97
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,559
And what is going on this time?

98
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Hi, Bridget. I'm feeding Hector cornflakes.

99
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Really? And why?

100
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,759
He's a turkey.

101
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Yes, of course he is.

102
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,919
Turkeys are made to eat lots for Christmas.

103
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,199
Well, we all eat lots at Christmas.

104
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
No, it's cruel.
It's to make them fat for humans to eat.

105
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,679
Let me guess. He is a baby cow?

106
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:15,599
Nearly. He is a veal calf. Poor thing.

107
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We're preparing
for our Farm Animal Freedom Protest.

108
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,559
No, you're not.

109
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
You're preparing this flat
because Marty Ross is coming for drinks.

110
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:36,439
Not Marty Ross?

111
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:40,119
Hey, darling, let's spend the evening together.

112
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Shut up, Nick. Go back to your bottle.

113
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,680
So this preparation, what is it?

114
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,519
I want this flat to look
like the coolest art gallery in London.

115
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
The Tate Modern.

116
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,839
-  The Tate Modern?
-  No furniture.

117
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,079
I want 21st century. I want art.

118
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,279
So how are you going to do this?

119
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
I'm not going to do it.

120
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:18,199
You are.

121
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,838
I must get my beauty sleep.

122
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,839
See you in the morning. Have fun.

123
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:36,479
Well, I'm not doing it.

124
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Come on, Nick. It won't take long.

125
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,200
I'll give Ziggy the keys to your flat.

126
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,400
OK, let's get on with it.

127
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,120
There! That's better.

128
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,159
Marty will love it.

129
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,959
The things I do for Bridget's love life.

130
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:52,439
What about Bridget's love life?

131
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,679
Right, I'll be back with Marty at six o'clock,

132
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,319
so, Annie, I want nibbles...

133
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,838
-  Nibbles?
-  Nuts, crisps.

134
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,119
Hector, you prepare the drinks.

135
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
And Nick...

136
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,919
try to be more interesting.

137
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Now, don't let me down.

138
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,920
I want 21st century. I want art.

139
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,480
Yeah...
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

140
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
I'll show her interesting.

141
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm taking the day off work today.

142
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,520
No, you're not.
We've got lots to do before tonight.

143
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,718
Bridget's nibbles?

144
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:48,719
No! The Farm Animal Freedom Protest.

145
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Boggy and Moss are coming here
and I want you to look after them, Hector. OK?

146
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,559
Come on, Ziggy.

147
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
Interesting?
I'll show you interesting, Bridget Evans.

148
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Interesting, interesting!

149
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,640
No, too Picasso.

150
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,519
No, too sporty and stupid.

151
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,919
Yes! This is the one.

152
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
No.

153
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,199
Don't be ridiculous.

154
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,279
Nearly. Not quite.

155
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Bingo!

156
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,799
Poor thing.

157
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,800
We're preparing
for our Farm Animal Freedom Protest.

158
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:34,319
I want 21st century. I want art.

159
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,919
Hey, darling, let's spend the evening together.

160
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,959
Shut up, Nick. Go back to your bottle.

161
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Oggy? Moth?

162
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Excuse me, I am... Nuts...

163
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Come in, come in.

164
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Please...sit down.

165
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
So, you are Annie's friends?

166
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,960
I am Annie's boyfriend.

167
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Would you like a drink?

168
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,840
You would? You wouldn't?

169
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Tea? Coffee? Sugar?

170
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,318
It is my phone.

171
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,959
I know you know it is a phone,

172
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,960
but it is ringing, so I must...

173
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Excuse me.

174
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:36,038
Annie, I'm so happy you rang.

175
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,039
Hector, I'm in the ladies' toilets
in Trafalgar Square.

176
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,398
Have Boggy and Moss arrived yet?

177
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,759
Yes.

178
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Annie, they are a bit...

179
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,959
Aren't they sweet?

180
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,959
Yes, very sweet.

181
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
It is just that they...

182
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:02,639
All right, chaps? Won't be a minute.

183
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,640
It is just that they are a bit scary.

184
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,879
Hector, don't be so silly.

185
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Tell them to come to Trafalgar Square now.

186
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
Great.

187
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
You found something to eat. Good.

188
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,359
You like them?

189
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Good, good, good.

190
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Annie says you can go to Trafalgar Square. Now.

191
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
It is the phone again.

192
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
Phones ring, don't they? They...

193
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,279
Excuse me.

194
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,719
Hello.

195
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Hello, Hector. Did you get the nibbles?

196
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,039
The nibbles. The nibbles.

197
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Well done, Hector. I knew I could rely on you.

198
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,440
That was Bridget, Annie's fr...

199
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,599
Now am I interesting?

200
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Do I look that bad?

201
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,640
This is interesting!

202
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
What shall I do? It was Boggy and Moss.

203
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,279
Look, don't worry. We can tidy this up.

204
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:01,199
Look. See? Look.

205
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,559
Yeah, that looks much better.

206
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,680
-  Still, at least I've brought the drinks.
-  And I have the nibbles.

207
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,039
-  What?
-  The nibbles.

208
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,278
Very good.

209
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,279
Oh, no! Boggy and Moss ate them.

210
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
Look at this!

211
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,999
Tastes good.

212
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,720
See? Bridget won't even notice the mess.

213
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:05,359
Marty, you're so funny.

214
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,119
Anyway, here is my humble home.

215
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,119
Mr Ross, I'm a huge fan.

216
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,720
What is that?

217
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,640
It's a pigpen. We stole it from a farm lorry.

218
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,038
What a shame, no pig.

219
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,039
Boggy and Moss are bringing her later.

220
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,720
-  This place...
-  This place is very...

221
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,798
I'm so angry!

222
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,799
..angry. I love it!

223
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,360
Yes. Yes, it's my angry art phase.

224
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,758
All my own ideas, you know.

225
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,759
-  Cocktail?
-  Nibble?

226
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And this is fantastic. Original?

227
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,998
Very original.

228
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,999
Very Damian Pollasco. I love art.

229
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,080
They call me Arty Marty, you know.

230
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Is it...for sale?

231
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,279
The man's an idiot. He wants to buy a wall.

232
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,198
Much too expensive.

233
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:41,199
Much too precious.

234
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:44,439
Name your price.

235
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,519
Can you deliver them to me tomorrow?

236
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Sure. No problem.

237
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,038
Nick, what's this cocktail called?

238
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,519
It's an Arty Marty.

239
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,520
It's rich, sickly and very thick.

240
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:20,239
Nick, your date is here.

241
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:24,319
Of course she is.

242
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,279
Next time in Extra...

243
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,599
Nick goes to the dentist.

244
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,638
Annie can't speak.

245
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:56,639
And why does an inspector call?
