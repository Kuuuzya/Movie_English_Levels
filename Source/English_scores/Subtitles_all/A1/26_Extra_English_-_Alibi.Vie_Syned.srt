1
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:17,159
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,120
and the boys next door,
Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
Annie cares about animals.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Hector cares about Annie.
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,520
Bridget mostly cares about herself.

6
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,159
But Nick doesn't care very much about anything.

7
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Stand by for Extra.

8
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,759
Bridget Evans?

9
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,879
Annie Taylor?

10
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,239
Detective David Hunt
of the Metropolitan Police.

11
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:33,919
Could I have a word with you, please?

12
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
So we went to the restaurant
and it was a very good vegetarian restaurant,

13
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,359
and I had the peppers
and Hector had the mushrooms,

14
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,559
which was very nice
because Hector doesn't like mushrooms,

15
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,159
so I said to him that it was good for him to try.

16
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Annie!

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,479
And then afterwards we went for a lovely walk

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,960
and it was such a beautiful evening

19
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:21,359
and the birds were singing...

20
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,838
Annie! Will you shut up?

21
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,839
Sorry.

22
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,798
You have been talking non- stop
for 20 minutes.

23
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,799
I know. It's...

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,120
It's because I'm doing a sponsored silence
for the charity Pigs With No Parents.

25
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,239
Sponsored...silence!

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
So why are you talking?

27
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,359
It doesn't start till ten o'clock, so if I talk
a lot now, then I won't have to talk later.

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Anyway, what's wrong with your mouth?

29
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,919
Nothing.

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,118
Have you got a spot?
I'll call an ambulance!

31
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:11,119
No, but I am going to see my beautician later.

32
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,760
What for?

33
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Just for a check- up.

34
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,039
A check- up? But you go to the dentist
for a check- up, for your teeth.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Exactly.
I'm going to the beautician's to check...

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Check that you are beautiful?

37
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,879
Of course not.
I don't have to check I'm beautiful, do I?

38
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,239
Hey, Nick! Do you like my new clothes?

39
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Nick!

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Nick! What is the matter?

41
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,598
You can tell me.

42
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,599
You have a toothache.

43
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,719
Then if you have a toothache,
you must go to the den...

44
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,639
Can't I say the word 'den...'?

45
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
OK, I won't say the D- word.

46
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:05,159
I call him 'plumber'.

47
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,679
OK, so when did you last see the plumber?

48
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,480
That's not too bad, five months ago.

49
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,359
Five years ago?

50
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,479
When you were five years old?

51
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
It is going to be a big job!

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,438
He'll need a big drill.

53
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,439
Come on.

54
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,079
The girls must know a good plumber.

55
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,318
Come on.

56
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,319
Do you want a sweetie?

57
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,879
Do you want a sweetie?

58
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Sweets are bad for your teeth. Come on.

59
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,599
Hi, sugar plum.

60
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Hello, snuggly puppykins.

61
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,479
Nice clothes. New?

62
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Yeah. Thanks.

63
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Is Nick rehearsing for the pantomime?

64
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,559
No, he has a toothache
so he must see the plumber.

65
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,439
No, no, no, Hector.
For a toothache, he must see the dentist.

66
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,240
I know that, but Nick doesn't like the D- word.

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,320
'Dentist'.

68
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,319
So I'm calling the dentist a plumber.

69
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,079
So do you know a good plumber?

70
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,080
A plumber? What for?

71
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,439
Nick has toothache.

72
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Well, he doesn't need a plumber.
He needs a dentist.

73
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,840
Yes, Hector, we have
the number of a very good plumber -  Julian.

74
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Julian!

75
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,919
He's so gentle.

76
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,199
He's so married!

77
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,120
Hi, Julian.

78
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Listen, we have an emergency here.

79
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,598
What are the symptoms?

80
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,599
Shaking, squealing...

81
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,199
Yeah, just a toothache.

82
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
You can?

83
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,559
Thank you. Bye.

84
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,039
Sorted. He'll see Nick now.

85
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,960
OK, come on, Nick.

86
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,959
Come on. Come on, Nick.

87
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,758
Come on...

88
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,959
Come on, Nick.

89
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,078
Julian looked in my mouth once.

90
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,959
He said, 'Bridget, you've got wonderful teeth.'

91
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,960
With a mouth that big,
I'm surprised he didn't fall in.

92
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Hello.

93
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Who's this?

94
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Bernard?

95
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Hello, Bernard.

96
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Hello, Bernard.

97
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,559
You've been what?

98
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Robbed?

99
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,760
When?

100
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,759
When you were in the bath?

101
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,760
All your clothes?

102
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,919
And your keys?

103
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,199
Poor Bernard.

104
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Listen, you must call the police, OK?

105
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,679
OK. Bye.

106
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:15,599
Poor Bernard.

107
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's ten o'clock!
My sponsored silence starts now.

108
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,559
He'll need a big drill.

109
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
If I talk a lot now,
then I won't have to talk later.

110
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:36,439
Have you got a spot?

111
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:40,119
I'll call an ambulance!

112
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,360
All your clothes?

113
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,680
And your keys?

114
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,519
Bridget Evans?

115
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
Annie Taylor?

116
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,839
Detective David Hunt
of the Metropolitan Police.

117
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,079
Could I have a word with you, please?

118
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,279
Why not?

119
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
You can't speak? I'm sorry.

120
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:18,199
You can speak.

121
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,838
Are you trying to be funny with me, young lady?

122
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,839
One word. Three syllables.

123
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:36,479
First syllable...

124
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Sit.

125
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Seat?

126
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Chair?

127
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Second syllable.

128
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,159
A? E?

129
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,959
I? I.

130
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:52,439
T.

131
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,679
Chair- I- T.

132
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,319
Chair- I- T?

133
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,838
You're being silent for charity!

134
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,119
But which charity?

135
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Cow? Dog? Cat?

136
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,919
Pig?

137
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Got it! Pigs Without Parents!

138
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Is this man bothering you, Annie?

139
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,480
Because if he is,
I am going to show him some Argentinian...

140
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Detective David Hunt
of the Metropolitan Police.

141
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
..respect.

142
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,520
-  And you are?
-  Hector Romero.

143
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,718
I suspect you're not English?

144
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:48,719
He is a very good detective.

145
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,880
And you are?

146
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,559
Nwiff?

147
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
He's just been to see the plumber.

148
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
-  The plumber?
-  Yes, he had a toothache.

149
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,640
But you don't go to the plumber
when you've got a toothache.

150
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,519
-  You go to the den...
-  Biscuit?

151
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,919
Dentist.

152
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Anyway, I'm here to investigate a robbery

153
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,199
of Bernard Reynolds'...

154
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,279
Somebody has stolen Bernard!

155
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,480
There's been a robbery
of Bernard Reynolds' clothes.

156
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,799
Who would want Bernard's clothes?
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

157
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,800
So I'm investigating everybody in the building

158
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:34,319
because someone
has stolen Bernard Reynolds' clothes.

159
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,919
Where were you last night?

160
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,959
I was with Annie.

161
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
-  Annie...
-  It's OK.

162
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
She can't speak for chair- I- T.

163
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Anyway, what about Nwiff?

164
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,720
I...

165
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Show me, Nick.

166
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,960
I went to Leo's Bar.

167
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,680
I had a beer.

168
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,840
There was a beautiful girl.

169
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,480
And a motorbike?

170
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,318
You were with a young woman on a motorbike?

171
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,959
Motorbike. Registration?

172
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Name of young woman?

173
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
He wasn't with her.

174
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:36,038
The young woman
was on television on a motorbike!

175
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,039
I saw that! Very nice!

176
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,398
Gee, I'm getting good at this.

177
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,759
Bridget Evans?

178
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Annie Taylor?

179
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,959
Detective David Hunt
of the Metropolitan Police.

180
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,959
Could I have a word with you, please?

181
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Chair- I- T?

182
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:02,639
Got it! Pigs Without Parents!

183
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,640
What about Nwiff?

184
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,879
Motorbike. Registration?

185
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Name of young woman?

186
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
There you are!

187
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Hello, Mr Reynolds.

188
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,359
Well, have you caught them?

189
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,360
-  Who?
-  The robbers.

190
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,080
The robbers who stole my clothes.

191
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Yes. My investigations are going very well.

192
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
You have a cold, Bernard?

193
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,279
You need some clothes?

194
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,719
What a week! First, Mum went away
to play bingo all weekend.

195
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Bingo?

196
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,039
Two fat ladies, 88.

197
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Clickety- click, 66.

198
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,440
Anyway, and then someone stole my clothes.

199
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,599
Bingo!

200
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Digestives! My favourite.

201
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,640
You must be Miss Evans.

202
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
And this is Sherlock Holmes!

203
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,279
Bridget.

204
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:01,199
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

205
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,559
Bernard's wearing my dressing gown!

206
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,680
What are you staring at?

207
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,039
Nothing.

208
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,278
Is there something wrong with your top lip?

209
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,279
No.

210
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
Yes, there is. It's bright red.

211
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,999
It doesn't show, does it?

212
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,720
No, no, no.

213
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:05,359
They told me in the salon no one would notice.

214
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,119
Thank you.

215
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,119
I wanted perfect lips, but I didn't have
enough money, so a student did them.

216
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,720
What, a butcher student?

217
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,640
There, there. You're still very pretty.

218
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,038
Am I? Really?

219
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,039
Really.

220
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Where were you last night?

221
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,798
-  Looking in the mirror.
-  All night?

222
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,799
Yes, all night.

223
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,360
How can anyone spend all night
looking at themselves in the mirror?

224
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,758
Bridget would.

225
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,759
I think that someone here

226
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
is not telling the truth

227
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,998
and I think that someone is you.

228
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,999
But I told you. I was with Annie.

229
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Annie hasn't said she was with you.

230
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,920
That's true.

231
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,279
She can't speak.

232
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,198
She is doing
a sponsored silence for chair- I- T.

233
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:41,199
It doesn't matter. Did you go out at all?

234
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:44,439
-  Yes.
-  Where?

235
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,519
-  Shopping.
-  Shopping?

236
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,920
For what?

237
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,038
Some new clothes.

238
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,519
These new clothes?

239
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Now, let me get this straight.

240
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:20,239
You need some new clothes
and Mr Reynolds' clothes have been stolen.

241
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:24,319
So what does that tell me?

242
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,279
Yes, but I...

243
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,599
Why buy new clothes
when you can steal somebody else's?

244
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,638
Yeah!

245
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:56,639
Do these look like Bernard's clothes?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They could be. My colour.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, no! I spoke!

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You! You made me speak!

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello? Yes, he's here. I'll get him.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bernard, it's your mother.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Mum. You're back.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How was bingo?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum, someone stole my clothes.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OK.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right, I'm off.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's back. She's cooking my tea.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bernard, what about your clothes?

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's OK. She's got them.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-  What?
-  What? What?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She put them in the washing machine
before she went to bingo.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So Bernard's clothes

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
were in the washing machine all the time.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, yes, as I suspected.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's another case solved. I'll be off, then.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, you won't!

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You owe me ?120 for Pigs With No Parents.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You made me speak!

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, will dollars do?

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Next time in Extra...

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The girls enter a game show.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And guess what Hector finds on his jumper.
