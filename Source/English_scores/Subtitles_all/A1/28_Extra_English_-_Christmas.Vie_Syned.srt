00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,080
and the boys next door, Nick,
and his friend Hector fro Argentina.

3
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:27,319
Hector and Annie are in love.

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,359
Bridget likes to party and party.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,960
And Nick will do anything
to earn some money.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,280
Stand by for Extra.
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

7
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,759
I love this time of year.

8
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,599
Sleigh bells, mince pies,
presents under the tree!

9
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,239
What? Easter?

10
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,319
No, silly! Christmas!

11
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,518
I'm going to show you what
a traditional English Christmas is like.

12
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,519
Starting with...mistletoe.

13
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,519
Mistle-toe?

14
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,079
It's an English tradition.

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,678
When you stand under it,
you can kiss someone.

16
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:52,558
But I am not under any mistletoe.

17
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,559
You are now.

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,320
Oh, you poor things!

19
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,639
You're stuck together again.

20
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,159
Don't worry, I can help!

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
There, panic over!

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,999
- Right, I'm off.
- What?

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Another television party?

24
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,279
Not a party, three more parties.

25
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,758
And that's just tonight.

26
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,759
But you've been to a Christmas
party every night for two weeks.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
I know.
It's so difficult being so popular.

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
First, there's a champagne party
at the Savoy,

29
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,079
then at nine o'clock
I'll get a taxi to the Ritz

30
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,678
and get changed on the way...

31
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,679
What? In the taxi?

32
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Naturally.

33
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,079
And then at 11 :30
I'll get a taxi to Annabel's.

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Annabel - who is she?

35
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,599
Annabel's - the night club.

36
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,039
Will you change your clothes
in the taxi again?

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,319
And there I hope
I Will meet a young, handsome man.

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,879
An early Christmas present!

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
I hate Christmas!

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Did you have a bad day
at the grotto, dear?

41
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,679
- Nick, is that snow?
- No.

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,078
Well, what,s that on your beard then?

43
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,079
I was holding this baby...

44
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
when suddenly...

45
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,479
- Christmas!
- But children Love Christmas.

46
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,039
- Is the money good?
- Yeah.

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,759
Well, stop complaining then!

48
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Hector and I are going to have
a lovely Christmas, aren't we?

49
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Christmas is all about
parties and presents!

50
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,839
So, Bridget, have you got your
Christmas stocking ready?

51
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,639
She's taking her stockings off
in the taxi!

52
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,839
Don't wait up.

53
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,279
What is a Christmas stocking?

54
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,959
On Christmas Eve,
you hang up your Christmas stocking

55
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,238
and a big, Jolly Father Christmas comes
and fills it up with presents!

56
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:10,239
Who put that sleigh there?

57
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,039
My sleigh! I forgot!

58
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,439
Mind my leq.

59
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,919
Right, right...
Whoa! Not too fast!

60
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,599
I feel terrible!

61
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
- Poor Bridget. Are you in pain?
- No.

62
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,720
But what about the parties?
I can,t go like this!

63
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,039
I could take you dancing!

64
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,159
Christmas is cancelled!

65
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,160
- Is that it?
- Yeah, crackers are great!

66
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,318
So, what else
do you have at Christmas?

67
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,319
Turkey, Christmas pudding, mince pies.

68
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Mince pies. How do you make them?

69
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:03,679
It's just pastry and mincemeat.

70
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,558
- Mincemeat?
- Yeah, it's traditional

71
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:25,559
It's sultanas, raisins and spices.
It's mince...

72
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,559
- Meat.
- Yeah.

73
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:50,119
Listen to this.

74
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,720
What do you get
if you cross a chicken with a clock?

75
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
- I don't know.
- An alarm cluck!

76
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,079
An alarm cluck!

77
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,959
I don't get it.

78
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:07,279
An alarm cluck!

79
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,479
One a cluck, two a cluck...

80
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,480
A clock?

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,518
Mistle-toe?

82
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,519
It's an English tradition.

83
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,279
When you stand under it,
you can kiss someone.

84
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,759
I was holding this baby...
when suddenly...

85
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,159
It's so difficult being so popular.

86
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,960
My sleigh! I forgot!

87
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,919
Mince pies!

88
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,559
First, the pastry!

89
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,560
And now the minced meat
from the best butcher!

90
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,479
They smell good, don't they, Charley?

91
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Well, I've finished
all my Christmas shopping.

92
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,079
Oh, madam!

93
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,159
Refreshment? Mince pie?

94
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,519
Mince pies? Hector, you are clever.

95
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,639
I followed the re-ceep.

96
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,279
- Pee.
- Mince pee?

97
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,879
No, no, no. Re-ci-pe.

98
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,559
Re-ci-pe.

99
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Good choice, madam. Merry Christmas!

100
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,438
Something wrong?

101
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:49,439
Delicious...Delicious.

102
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,959
You know, Hector,
Christmas is all about sharing.

103
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Would you like some, Charley?

104
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,360
It's Saint Nicholas!

105
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,120
What happened to your beard?

106
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,159
One Christmas candle,
one small child...

107
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,839
Mince pies, yummy!

108
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,439
With best mince from the best butcher.

109
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Hector. What did you put in the pies?

110
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,358
Minced meat - from the best butcher.

111
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,118
This is mincemeat.

112
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:31,119
This is minced meat.

113
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,958
Isn't it the same thing?

114
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,959
- Not quite.
- Delicious!

115
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
I've got an idea!

116
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,238
Let's make this a special Christmas,
just for Bridget.

117
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:55,239
Night-night.

118
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Hey, Bridget.

119
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,480
- Do you want to come carol singing?
- Who is Carol?

120
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Carols are Christmas songs.

121
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,759
You knock on people's doors
and sing to them for money.

122
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
- Let's do it!
- For charity!

123
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,318
For poor little children.

124
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:23,319
Some children have no Christmas.

125
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,399
Just like me.

126
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
And your job as Santa Claus
is so important.

127
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,160
You help children
to believe in Christmas!

128
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,399
Yes, you're right, Annie, I do.

129
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,439
My job is important!

130
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,999
I help children to believe!

131
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,958
Right, let's go!

132
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,959
I'll go, only if we can sing Abba songs.

133
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
And that Will make you happy?

134
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Here, have a mince pie.

135
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,879
All right.

136
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Away in a manger...

137
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,038
Dog in a manger more like! Good night!

138
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,039
Silent night...

139
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,159
I wish you were - all night!

140
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,679
We Three Kings of Orient are

141
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
One on a scooter, one in a car...

142
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Get Iost!

143
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Merrlly on high...

144
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Get 'em, Gnasher!

145
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,718
Come all ye faithful

146
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:19,719
Joyful and tri...

147
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:26,798
Hi, Annie. I like the tree.

148
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,799
Thank you. It's nearly finished.

149
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Please, use these. My decorations.

150
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,679
Oh, sweet, Hector.

151
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,400
- Are they from Argentina?
- No.

152
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Oxford Street.

153
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,079
- Aren't they great?
- Great.

154
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Hi, Nick.
How was your Iast day as Santa Claus?

155
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:16,439
Great! Such nice children.

156
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440
One of them
let me play with his binoculars!

157
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Really?

158
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,840
And I've just finished
my Christmas shopping.

159
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
- But the shops are shut now.
- No.

160
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:47,878
The petrol station was open.

161
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,879
Look I've bought my mum this.

162
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,919
A map of Watford.

163
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
- But your mum doesn't live in Watford.
- I know.

164
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,159
She might go there one day, though.

165
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,319
I bought shampoo for my sister.

166
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:21,599
Car shampoo.

167
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,719
Yeah. And aftershave for my dad.

168
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,720
I like the tree...but I Love these!

169
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,999
I've got some too.

170
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
It was the Iast day of the grotto today,
so they were throwing these away.

171
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,679
Can you believe it!
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

172
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
No!

173
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,958
Perfect.

174
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,959
Well, it might make Bridget Iaugh.

175
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:55,719
Why?

176
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:02,199
I know. If Bridget can't go to her parties,
let's have a party here!

177
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,039
- When?
- Oh, I don't know.

178
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,040
In about 15 minutes?

179
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:25,879
Look at the Christmas tree!

180
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,080
I know. It makes me want to cry too.

181
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,680
What's the point of having Christmas
if I can't go to my Christmas parties?!

182
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,599
Now Christmas just makes me cry!

183
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,999
Bridget, cheer up.

184
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Tomorrow is Christmas Day.

185
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,599
Have you got your stocking?

186
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Yes.

187
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
And I've got mine!

188
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,559
What are you hoping for? A motorbike?

189
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,038
Yes! Why not?

190
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,039
The only thing
that Will make this Christmas worse

191
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
is if you invited all my friends round
for a surprise party to cheer me up.

192
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Surprise!

193
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,919
And now the minced meat,
from the best butcher!

194
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,159
They smell good, don't they, Charley?

195
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,160
We Three Kings of Orient are

196
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,840
One on a scooter, one in a car...

197
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,999
Good night!

198
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,119
Joyful and tri...

199
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Surprise!

200
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Hang on, I,m coming!

201
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,798
- Merry Christmas!
- Hello, Bernard. Merry Christmas.

202
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,839
I'm sorry,
we had a little party Iast night.

203
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,840
I'm here for dinner.

204
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:21,279
Isn't it a bit early?

205
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,159
Ten o'clock, time for a sherry.

206
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,758
- Bernard, where's your mother?
- At church.

207
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,118
Well, I'll just go and get dressed.

208
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,119
To Bernard, Love from Annie.

209
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,839
Sherry. Thanks, Annie.

210
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,359
Nearly finished this one.

211
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,560
To Bridget, Love from Annie.

212
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,159
A flea collar? I haven,t got fleas!

213
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,039
I'm sorry, Bridget, wrong label.
It was meant for Charley.

214
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,119
Is she sure it was meant for Charley?

215
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,920
To Bridget, from Hector.

216
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Thank you, Hector. You shouldn't have.

217
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,840
What To Wear At Christmas Parties.

218
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,840
I bought it before you...

219
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,040
I've got a little something for you, Nick.

220
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:55,479
Gorilla -
because you are the original man.

221
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
It smells like a gorilla.

222
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,199
Well, you should know.

223
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
I wonder what this could be.

224
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,278
Merry Christmas, sugar plum.

225
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,279
Merry Christmas, snuggly-puppykins.

226
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,119
One heart, forever.

227
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
This Will stop it!

228
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,079
Bridget, nothing Will stop
my Love for Hector.

229
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,678
Well...

230
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,679
I just called to say Merry Christmas!

231
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Hector.

232
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Bridget, what has happened to you?

233
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:46,439
- I had an accident.
- Oh, what a pity!

234
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,279
You've missed some fabulous parties -

235
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,438
especially at the Beckhams'.

236
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:59,439
Elton John is a very naughty boy!

237
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,399
Still, never mind,
there is always next year.

238
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,758
OK, must dash.

239
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,759
Off to a top restaurant for lunch.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Eunice?
- Yes?

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before you go, have a mince pie. Nick?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I shouldn't...but it's Christmas.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's true, there is a Santa!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she's a woman! Wait for me!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to tell you
what I really want for Christmas!

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Can you smell something?
- Yeah.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is something burning?

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I forgot - the turkey!

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Water, water! We need water!

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not on me! On the turkey!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Move! Move!

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There. The fire is out.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyone for turkey?!

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall we just have pudding?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No mince pies, thanks.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have another surprise for you.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Another English Christmas tradition.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Chocolate log. One slice or two?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Next time in Extra...

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nick wants to join the SAS,

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bridget and Annie
train the boys for action

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and why is Hector home so late?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Hector!
