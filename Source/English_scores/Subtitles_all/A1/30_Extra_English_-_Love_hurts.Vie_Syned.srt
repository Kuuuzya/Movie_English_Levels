00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,359
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,719
and the boys next door,
Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,798
Hector and Annie were in love,

4
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:29,399
but now things are not so good.
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Bridget has given up on love,

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,640
And Nick -  well, his mum loves him!

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Stand by for Extra!

8
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,118
Hector.

9
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,119
-  Yes?
-  Please could you pass the salt?

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Yes.

11
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,079
Hector.

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,198
Yes?

13
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:00,199
Please could you pass the pepper?

14
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:04,159
Of course.

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Hector.

16
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,319
Let me guess.
Can I pass the sugar, coffee, tea?

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,320
Actually, I was going to say we should talk.

18
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,959
So, now you want to talk to me!

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,639
It's only been a week!

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,640
-  I was hurt!
-  Well, you hurt me too.

21
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,599
-  I didn't go out with Eunice!
-  I didn't go out with Eunice!

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Yes, you did! And you stayed out
till three o'clock in the morning!

23
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,359
There were other people there, too.

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,360
-  Who?
-  People who work on the programme.

25
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,959
You mean other women
who work on the programme.

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Yes, and men -  why not, huh?

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,718
I knew it!

28
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,719
So, who is she?

29
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,918
-  Who?
-  The other woman.

30
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,919
There is no other woman!

31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Huh!

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,558
Annie, listen.

33
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,559
Excuse me.

34
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:19,958
Hello. Hi, Debbie.

35
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,879
How are you? Good.

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,880
OK, that'll be OK. Perfect! See you then.

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,440
Bye.

38
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,919
So, was that her?

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,160
-  Who?
-  Debbie. The other woman!

40
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,758
That was Debbie from the make- up department,
confirming my call time for tomorrow.

41
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,759
Some excuse!

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,198
-  Hector.
-  Yes.

43
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,998
Please could you pass me your fork?

44
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,999
Here, I'm going.

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,079
You can have my dinner!

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,080
You should have seen Eunice's face!

47
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:09,119
She was furious!

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,199
When Eunice gets angry,
she is a very scary lady!

49
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Hello.

50
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,678
Yes.

51
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:45,278
Excuse me. No, no, to her...

52
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,279
Bye, Bridget.

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,159
All right, Hector. Bye.

54
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,438
Hola, Lola!

55
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,278
-  Guess what?
-  Prince William wants to marry you?

56
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,158
I know that! No, I've got a promotion!

57
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:01,159
That's nice.

58
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,039
Nice? Nice!

59
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,519
It's fantastic! I am editor of Channel 9 Live!

60
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,599
Eunice is no longer my boss!

61
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,959
Is that Hugh Grant?

62
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
It's Bridget Evans here.
Call me Gigi, editor of Channel 9 Live.

63
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,638
Are we still on for lunch at Claridge's today?

64
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,879
Fab! Ciao!

65
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,839
Eunice is so jealous!

66
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,678
Now, that is good news.

67
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,679
Annie, what are you doing?

68
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,878
I'm doing my own editing.

69
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,879
Why are you cutting up
photos of you and Hector?

70
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Because Hector is no longer my boyfriend.

71
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Really?

72
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Why?

73
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,759
Because he is having an affair!

74
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,118
Really?! Who with?

75
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,119
Well, I thought it was Eunice,
but now I think it's Debbie.

76
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:51,039
Well, I just heard him on the phone to Lola.

77
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,999
Lola? Who's she?

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ha! Eunice, Debbie, Lola!

79
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
He's women mad!

80
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
It's fantastic!

81
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,679
I am editor of Channel 9 Live!

82
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,559
Hola, Lola!

83
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
I didn't go out with Eunice!

84
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,119
Yes, you did! And you stayed out
till three o'clock in the morning!

85
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,398
So, was that her?

86
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,399
-  Who?
-  Debbie. The other woman!

87
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,599
Hi, Nick.

88
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,720
What are you doing?

89
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
I am not doing, I am being.

90
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,118
What are you being?

91
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:37,119
-  Can't you guess?
-  A man on the toilet?

92
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,039
A Sumo wrestler?

93
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Can't you see? I am an egg.

94
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,318
Of course, you are an egg.

95
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:47,319
Now, what sort of egg am I?

96
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Hard- boiled.

97
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,159
-  Scrambled.
-  Scrambled?

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,758
-  Fried.
-  Nearly!

99
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,759
Poached!

100
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,839
Yeah, of course. You are a poached egg.

101
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Yeah.

102
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,519
Well, you're making a mess on your bed!

103
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,319
Anyway, why are you being a poached egg?

104
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,598
It's my new acting class.

105
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:18,599
Total Being.

106
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,799
What are you next week? A piece of wood?

107
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,560
-  A piece of wood?
-  Yeah! Then it would be wooden acting!

108
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Anyway, can poached eggs talk?

109
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,118
Don't be silly! Of course poached eggs can't talk.

110
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:57,119
No, no, I mean,

111
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
when you are
'being' a poached egg, can you talk?

112
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Yeah.

113
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,959
Anyway, I want to stop now,
my arms are hurting.

114
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,158
So, what do you want to talk about?

115
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,159
It is Annie.

116
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,759
She thinks I am having an affair.

117
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,760
-  Who with?
-  Eunice.

118
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,519
-  And Debbie.
-  What?

119
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Two women, Hector!

120
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,519
You cheeky thing!

121
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,080
But I am not!

122
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,120
-  So tell Annie then.
-  I have but she doesn't believe me.

123
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,999
-  Why not?
-  I don't know.

124
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,958
Excuse me.

125
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:46,999
Hola, Lola.

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,918
I'll take this outside.

127
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,919
How are you, Lola?

128
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,879
So, it's not Eunice,
it's not Debbie, could it be - Lola?

129
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,999
Stop, please!

130
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,599
I knew it!

131
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
It had to be a selfish man- driver!

132
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,519
Please, I have a voucher.

133
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,520
I- I am sorry, I've started, so I'll finish.

134
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,879
Look, I am Zeus, why are you so angry?

135
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,880
I'm not. I am just doing my job - Zeus!

136
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,319
People park on yellow lines and then are
surprised when they get a parking ticket!

137
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,879
There was this one guy today -
'Please, I have a voucher.'

138
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,078
No excuse!

139
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,158
Mind you, he was quite cute.

140
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,759
Nick.

141
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Nick, are you OK?

142
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,119
Bridget! Oh, it's you, Hector.

143
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,959
Well, there's something wrong with Nick.

144
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,878
-  Well, I could have told you that!
-  No, he won't speak, he won't move.

145
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,879
I know. He is being a poached egg.

146
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
-  A what?
-  For his new acting class.

147
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,558
Hi, Nick.
[Translated by 24hmedia.net]

148
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,719
Let me guess.

149
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,678
You are being - a potato.

150
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,679
Do I look like a potato?

151
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Yes. A couch potato!

152
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,519
What about a fish?

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,839
Yes, a frozen fish!

154
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,078
I am not a fish.

155
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,079
I...am...'Pain'.

156
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,520
You are a pain.

157
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,359
Yes, Nick is a pain!

158
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,358
No! I am 'Pain'.

159
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,359
Hurt, agony.

160
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,799
So, how was your first day as editor, Bridget?

161
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,080
What a day!

162
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
I had a very important meeting.
Big decisions to make.

163
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,638
Like which celebrities,
new programme ideas?

164
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,639
No, like which pen to use at my meeting?

165
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,559
Blue, black...

166
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,278
-  Which one did you choose?
-  Blue.

167
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,279
Bad choice.

168
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,599
You think so? Oh, no!

169
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:10,439
Eunice is so jealous of Bridget's new job,
she won't talk to anyone!

170
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,358
-  Not even you?
-  Not even me! It is great!

171
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,918
You don't want her to talk to you?

172
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,919
-  Really?
-  Really!

173
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,198
Oh, Annie, I hate it when we argue.

174
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,199
So do I.

175
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,399
-  I miss you.
-  I miss...

176
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Hola, Lola.

177
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,039
Right. Two can play that game.

178
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,119
I am not doing, I am being.

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,319
A man on the toilet?

180
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,639
Yeah!

181
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,638
I am not a fish! I...am...'Pain'.

182
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,639
It's not Eunice,
it's not Debbie, could it be -  Lola?

183
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,878
Hola, Lola!

184
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,358
Look, I am Zeus. Why are you so angry?

185
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,359
I am just doing my job - Zeus!

186
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,279
-  Hello again.
-  Hello.

187
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,280
-  We meet again.
-  You're happier today.

188
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,039
Yes, I am now!

189
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:14,959
But I'm sorry...

190
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,638
I parked here, so you would come back.

191
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,639
You wanted to see me again?

192
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,878
You are so beautiful!

193
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,879
Well, I'm sorry
but I am going to have to give you...

194
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,479
-  No...
-  This!

195
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,480
My phone number.

196
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Call me.

197
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Who needs Hector?

198
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Hi, Bridget.

199
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:03,119
What 'oh'?

200
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,398
I know -  Superman!

201
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,158
-  What?
-  I mean, Clark Kent.

202
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,159
You are being Clark Kent, for your acting class.

203
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,558
No. I'm not.

204
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,559
I'm long- sighted.

205
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,798
You're being long- sighted?

206
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,198
No.

207
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,199
I am long- sighted.

208
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,839
I need to wear glasses for reading.

209
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,719
They suit you.

210
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,519
Thank you.
So, why are you not at Channel 9 today?

211
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,520
I'm working from home today.

212
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,158
I've so much to do!

213
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,318
Bridget, what's the matter?

214
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,319
I can't do it! Eunice hates me!

215
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,158
Eunice hates everybody!

216
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,159
-  They all hate me!
-  No, they don't!

217
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,878
-  They all look at me!
-  Bridget, you are their boss.

218
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,879
I have to use the executive loo!

219
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,519
What's the matter with that?

220
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:41,359
I want to chat to all the girls!

221
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,799
Bridget...

222
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,999
you are one of the cleverest,
most beautiful women I know.

223
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Really?

224
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,518
-  Well, who are the others?
-  What do you mean?

225
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,519
You said I was only one of the cleverest,
most beautiful girls you know.

226
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Bridget! You can do this job.

227
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Channel 9 needs you.

228
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:42,439
-  Thank you, Nick.
-  Hey, it was nothing.

229
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:47,199
You really look handsome in those glasses.

230
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,319
Hi, Annie.

231
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,519
Hi, Hector.

232
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,520
-  You look smart.
-  Yes, I am going to meet someone.

233
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,359
Annie, I have something to tell you.

234
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,158
Sorry.

235
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,159
Lola!

236
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:31,559
Vale. Si, si, ya voy.

237
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,159
Hasta luego.

238
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,160
'Annie, I have something to tell you.'

239
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,358
That he is going on a date with Lola!
That's what!

240
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,118
Nick, stop it! You're tickling me!

241
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,719
Hi, Annie. I didn't hear you come in.

242
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Nick! Stop it!

243
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,799
Is everybody happy, apart from me?

244
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,039
Hello.

245
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,719
Zeus! Hi!

246
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,079
Well, of course I remember you!

247
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,918
A drink? Tonight?

248
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,679
Well, I'd love to.

249
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,878
Stop it! You're tickling me!

250
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,879
Zeus, meet my friends, Bridget and Nick.

251
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,439
-  Hi.
-  Hi.

252
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,438
Well, hello, Zeus!

253
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,879
Annie, where did you find him?

254
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses,
though, does he?

255
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,438
We've had a lovely evening, haven't we, Zeus?

256
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:17,439
Wonderful, Annie.

257
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,158
Now I must say goodnight.

258
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,638
Please, first may I use your bathroom?

259
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:25,118
-  Certainly.
-  Thank you.

260
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,238
Zeus is such a gentle man.

261
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,638
He certainly is a man.

262
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,038
Hi.

263
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,039
Annie, I must talk to you.

264
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,918
What about? Your date with Lola?

265
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,919
My date with Lola?

266
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,199
Annie, Lola is a 60- year- old
chief executive for ATV.

267
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,319
-  What's ATV?
-  Argentinian Television.

268
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,358
And...

269
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,479
She wants me to return to Argentina
to present their number one show.

270
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,638
But I don't want to go.

271
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,598
I want to stay here - with you.

272
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,079
That's better.

273
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,318
Hector, this is...

274
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,599
Zeus, my new boyfriend.

275
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,078
We've had a lovely evening, haven't we!

276
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,079
Come on, I'll say goodbye to you downstairs!

277
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,240
So, Hector, will you take the job?

278
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,438
What do you think I should do, Annie?

279
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:45,439
So we must say goodbye
to our friends for now.

280
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,638
Will Hector stay, or go back to Argentina?

281
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,639
Will Annie go with him?

282
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,518
And will Nick ever give up on Bridget?

283
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,798
Extra - will the story continue?!
