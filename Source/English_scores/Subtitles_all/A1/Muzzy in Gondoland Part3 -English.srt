00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:10,896
Go away!

2
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:18,691
Ah, Sylvia.

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,413
I love you.

4
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:27,968
S - y - l - v - i - a.

5
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:30,923
That's right.

6
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:35,616
Corvax... loves... Sylvia.

7
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,369
Oh, Sylvia!

8
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:42,931
Your eyes, your...

9
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:47,823
The Body.

10
00:00:51,828 --> 00:00:53,181
A head.

11
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:56,622
An eye.

12
00:00:57,778 --> 00:00:59,689
An eye.

13
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:01,927
A nose.

14
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:04,212
A mouth.

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,440
An ear.

16
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:10,400
A neck.

17
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:13,530
An arm.

18
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:15,689
An arm.

19
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,891
A hand.

20
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:20,211

23
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:26,650
A foot.

24
00:01:27,293 --> 00:01:28,806
A foot.

25
00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:31,387
Good!

26
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:33,090
Good!

27
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:36,042
My Sylvia.

28
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:38,729
I've got you now.

29
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,749
Print!

30
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:47,616
Lovely.

31
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:50,089
That's good.

32
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:07,903
Where is it?

33
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:17,128
Here it is!
And this.

34
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,222
And this.

35
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,849
Now where...?

We!

45
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,292
We're friends.

46
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,790

00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:59,811
Lovely, delicious,

58
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:01,394
Oh no. No, thanks.

59

65
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:18,816
We are free!

66
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:24,137
You are free and I am free.

67
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:27,808
We are free.

68
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:31,866

I'm free!

74
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:07,971
I'm wet, I'm cold

75
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:10,613
and I'm hungry.

76
00:05:10,864 --> 00:05:13,454
But I'm free.

77
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:23,730
Cold.

78
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:28,377
Hot.

79
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:32,731
Hungry.

80
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,724
Thirsty.

81
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:43,088
Wet.

82
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:47,497
Dry.

83
00:05:58,265 --> 00:06:00,984
-I'm thirsty!
-Have a drink.

84
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:04,131
It's hot!

85
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:06,215
Oh, sorry!

86
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:10,724
-I'm hungry.
-Have a hamburger.

87
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:19,890
I'm hot.

88
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:22,313
Have a shower.

89
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:25,450
I'm wet.

90
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,507
Have a towel.

91
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:34,370
I'm cold.

92
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:36,695
Have a sweater.

93
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:39,496
I'm tired.

94
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,373
Have a rest.

95
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:49,533
It's cold.

96
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:51,527
Bob!

97
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:53,862
Bob?

98
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,010
Where are you?

99
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:57,354
Bob!

100
00:06:58,478 --> 00:06:59,432
Muzzy!

101
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:02,502
Bob! Where are you?

102
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,220
-Here!
-Where?

103
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:07,922
I can't see you.

104
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,137
I'm here. In the tree.

105
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,099
What tree?

106
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:15,115
This tree.

107
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:17,696
Where are you?

108
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:20,624
I'm under...

109
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:29,597
Where?

110
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,256
Where are you?

111
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:35,609
Under the box.

112
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,684
Where are you?

113
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:39,816
On the box.

114
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:42,753
Where are you?

115
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:44,541
In the box.

116
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,611
Where are you?

117
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:49,053
In front of the box.

118
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,495
Where are you?

119
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:53,768
Behind the box.

120
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:55,594
Where are you?

121
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:57,537
Between the boxes.

122
00:07:58,274 --> 00:08:02,169
-Where's the box?
-Over there.

123
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:07,168
-Where's the box now?
-Over here.

124
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,491
In, on, under,

125
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:14,853

00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:21,296
In, on, under,

128
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,456

between.

130
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:33,256
Are you all right?

131
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,573
Are you all right?

132
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:37,291
Oh, yes.

133
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:41,817
Just cold and wet
and hungry.

134
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,177
Where's the palace?

135
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:46,050
It's over there.

136
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,011
Where?

137
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:51,994
There it is, over there.

138
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,409
That's the palace.

139
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:57,690
Sylvia's there!

140
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:05,247
I'm Corvax.

141
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,491
Listen!

142
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:10,811
Can you hear me?

143
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:14,006
Look!

144
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:16,686
Can you see me?

145
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:20,773
Can you talk?

146
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:22,771
Yes, I can.

147
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,616
Can you walk?

148
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:27,536
No, I can't.

149
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:44,332
Let me try again.

150
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:48,772
Now can you walk?

151
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:51,134
Yes, I can.

152
00:09:51,698 --> 00:09:53,529
Can you run?

153
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:57,048
No, I can't.

154
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,619
Let me try again.

155
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:01,610
Sylvia,

156
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:05,731
do you love me?

157
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:09,335
No, I don't.
I don't like you.

158
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:11,176
Oh, Sylvia!

159
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:14,412
Now I can run. Bye!

160
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:16,854
Sylvia stop!

161
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:18,650
Come back!

162
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,289
What's happening?

163
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:41,331
I can walk.

164
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:43,611
I can talk.

165
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,811
I can hear.

166
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:47,970
I can see.

167
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:50,848
-Who are you?
-Am I you?

168
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,970
Are you me?

169
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:58,528
-I can jump.
-I can swim.

170
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:00,649

-This is fun.

171
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:02,655
-I am you.
-You are me.

172
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:05,816
Who are we?

173
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:13,367
Who are you?

174
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:16,003
-I'm Sylvia.
-I'm Sylvia.

175
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,424
-I'm Sylvia.

176
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,018
-I'm Sylvia.
-I'm Sylvia.

177
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:24,936
You're Sylvia.

178
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:27,016
Yes, we are.

179
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:30,550
-Six Sylvias?
-Yes.

180
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:33,576
Who are they?

181
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,011
Sylvia!

182
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:42,052
Six Sylvias!

183
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:51,773
You've got a green dress.

184
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,770
You've got a red dress.

185
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:58,096
She's got a blue dress.
I like brown.

186
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:04,570
I've got a yellow dress.

187
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,973
Yellow is for happiness.

188
00:12:07,178 --> 00:12:11,217
Black and white looks all
right.

189
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:14,728
But I like brown.

190
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,308
Black...

191
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:22,890
and white.

192
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,177
Yellow.

193
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:28,571
Blue.

194
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,296
Red.

195
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,497
Green.

196
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:36,057
Brown.

197
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,090
See you!
