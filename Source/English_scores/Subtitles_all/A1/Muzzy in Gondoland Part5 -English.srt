-There!
-Where,

60
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:22,404
on the first floor?

No, it's on the second floor.

62
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,564
Oh, there are three rooms
on the second floor.

63
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:31,884

It's the one in the middle.

69
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:06,641
What about the room up there?

70
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:09,436
The one on the top floor.

71
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:13,356
That's Corvax's room.
It's the computer room.

72
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:58,435
Stop it! Stop it!

73
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,683
No! No! No!

74
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:08,037
Food. Clocks. Seven p.m.

75
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,204
I've got some food.

76
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:14,004
I've got some clocks.

77
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:16,797
And it's nearly seven o'clock.

78
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,360
OK.

79
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:22,764
Open the door... quietly!

80
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:28,402
Look around... carefully!

81
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:32,565
Run downstairs... quickly!

82
00:06:33,212 --> 00:06:34,918
Hello Sylvia!

83
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,080
Hello.

84
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:39,520
That's me!

85
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,360
Oh!

86
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:49,476
It's seven. Bob's waiting.

87
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:54,725
That's me again!

88
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:00,597
Seven o'clock!

89
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,243
It's dinner-time, Sylvia!

90
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:07,166
-Yes, Mummy.
-Yes, Mummy.

91
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:09,721
-Yes, Mummy.
-Yes, Mummy.

92
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:24,044
Look, they're all Sylvias.

93
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:30,086
How many are there?

94
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:34,299
There are three in the kitchen.

95
00:07:34,324 --> 00:07:36,252
Four in the hall.

96
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:38,362
There's one by the fireplace.

97
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:41,196
There are two against the wall.

98
00:07:41,747 --> 00:07:43,927
There's one in the sitting-room

99
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,849
bouncing on the chairs.

100
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:48,263
And four are having lots of
fun,

101
00:07:48,325 --> 00:07:50,637
sliding down the stairs.

102
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,966
There are hundreds in the
garden

103
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:55,759
picking all the flowers.

104
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:58,378
And lots in the bathrooms

105
00:07:58,403 --> 00:08:00,876
turning on the showers.

106
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,636
Lots on the chandeliers.

107
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:05,643
More over there!

108
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:09,879
More of them and more of them,
appearing everywhere!

109
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:14,439
More of them and more of them,
appearing everywhere!

110
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:18,759
Where are they all coming from?

111
00:08:20,894 --> 00:08:21,698
Look,

112
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:25,721
they're coming from Corvax's
room upstairs.

113
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:29,680
What's he doing?
Go and see... quick!

114
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:32,515
Stop it! Stop it!

115
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,045
Help!

116
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:37,701
Corvax!

117
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:39,857
What are you doing?

118
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:42,784
I'm not doing anything.

119
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:45,324
It's the computer.

120
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:52,242
Help!

121
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,911
Listen!

122
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:55,270
Help!

123
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,915
It's Sylvia.

124
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:02,479
Oh, Bob!
I'm frightened.

125
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:04,165
Why?

126
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,999
Why are you frightened?

127
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:09,916
Because there are
lots of Sylvias in the palace.

128
00:09:09,978 --> 00:09:13,124
-Sylvias?
-Excuse me.

129
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:16,689
Have you got any clocks?

130
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,658
-Oh, Muzzy!
-Here you are.

131
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:22,739
Muzzy, why do you eat clocks?

132
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:26,005
Because I like them,
of course.

133
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,484
Why?

134
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,604
Oh, dear! He's crying.

135
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:47,704
Why are you crying?

136
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:50,228
Because I can't reach the apple.

137
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,204
Why can't you reach the apple?

138
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:54,325
Because I'm small.

139
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:56,239
I can reach the apple.

140
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:57,640
Yes.

141
00:09:57,692 --> 00:10:00,598
-Why?
-Because you're tall.

142
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:02,041
Right!

143
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:04,516
-Here you are!
-Thanks.

144
00:10:04,597 --> 00:10:06,085
Bye!

145
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:11,284
Hey! That's my apple,
and my bike.

146
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:15,761
Come back! Come back!

147
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:18,039
That's mine!

148
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,530
Gotcha!

149
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:24,844
Now, is this my bike?

150
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,116
Yes, it's yours.

151
00:10:27,155 --> 00:10:29,523
Yes, it's mine.

152
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,196
And where's my apple?

153
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,093
You can't have it.

154
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,479
-Why not?
-Because it's in here.

155
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:40,763
Oh, Bob.

156
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:44,481
Lots of Sylvias?

157
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:52,963
Ah! I see.

158
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,442
Corvax!
The computer!

159
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:00,361
Bob! Where are you going?

160
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:03,080
To the computer room.
Come on!

161
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:04,514
Follow me!
