1
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:16,553
Corvax!
Stop the computer!

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,709
I can't, your Majesty.

3
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:22,929
Of course you can.
It’s your computer.

4
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,406
Yes, I know.

5
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:28,528
It’s mine, but I can't stop it.

6
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:30,618
Well I can stop it.

7
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,012
Excuse me. Excuse me.

8
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:39,127
Be careful! Be careful!

9
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:41,739
It’s all right, Corvax.

10
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:46,201
Don't do that!

11
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:55,083
Corvax! Corvax!

12
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,540
Help me!

13
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:02,076
Look!

14
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,731
-There's one!
-And there's one!

15
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:06,614
And there!

16
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:09,578
Oh, there are lots of them!

17
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,527
There's a fat one!

18
00:01:13,092 --> 00:01:15,935
Ah, that one's fatter!
Look!

19
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,378
There's a big one!

20
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:21,053
That's a bigger one over there!

21
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:22,933
Come on, Muzzy!

22
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:30,933
I’m big.

23
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:34,013
I’m bigger.

24
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:36,413
The first one's big.

25
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,212
The second one's bigger.

26
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:40,935
I’m small.

27
00:01:41,122 --> 00:01:43,997
Yes. The third one's small.

28
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,166
And the fourth one's smaller.

29
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:50,472
The fifth is tall.

30
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:53,527
The sixth is taller.

31
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:58,415
The seventh is... fat.

32
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:01,207
And the eighth is...

33
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:02,989
Fatter.

34
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:06,375
Fatter.

35
00:02:10,736 --> 00:02:12,654
Help me, Corvax.

36
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,132
I can't, your Majesty.

37
00:02:16,696 --> 00:02:18,414
Silly! You're silly!

38
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,011
Oh dear! What can I do?

39
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:24,176
Ah, I can run away.

40
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:27,088
Yes! The helicopter!

41
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:32,439
Help!
Help, Corvax! Corvax!

42
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:35,413
Excuse me, your Majesty.

43
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:38,528
What's happening?
Where are you going?

44
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,293
To the helicopter.

45
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,895
Help!

46
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:48,410
The King's in the computer,
Corvax.

47
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,325
Stop! Come back!

48
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:53,353
Corvax!

49
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:56,291
Hey, stop!

50
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:02,301
Muzzy, go up there
to the computer room!

51
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:05,887
Help the Queen.
I can stop Corvax.

52
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:08,486
Sorry!

53
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,291
Excuse me!

54
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:13,209
Excuse me.

55
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,293
Oh, I beg your pardon.

56
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:20,436
Stop! Stop!

57
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:22,291
Stop!

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,567
Who's... What's that?

59
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:31,928
It’s all right.
That's Muzzy.

60
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:33,970
He's a friend.

61
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:37,152
Muzzy, this is the Queen.

62
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,839
Your Majesty!

63
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:44,152
What's happening?
What's that green thing?

64
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:48,697
Oh, that's not a thing.
That's Muzzy.

65
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:50,569
He's a friend.

66
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:54,330
But he can't help!
Where's Corvax?

67
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:58,126
Ah, yes.
Corvax can help.

68
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,327
Corvax is clever.

69
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:03,099
No, he isn't. He's silly.

70
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:06,004
I can help, your Majesty.

71
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:08,903
You?
But you aren't clever.

72
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:10,455
I am.

73
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:14,644
Lovely!

74
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:16,692
What are you doing, Muzzy?

75
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:18,695
Wait a moment!

76
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:40,016
-What are you doing?
-Excuse me.

77
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:41,893
I’m hungry.

78
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:43,575
Hungry?

79
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:45,894
But the King's in there.

80
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:48,602
Why are you eating that?

81
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:51,088
Because I like it.

82
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:56,974
Ah, I see.

83
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:59,698
This goes here.

84
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,095
This goes here.

85
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,693
No, no it doesn't.

86
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:07,930
Careful, please, Muzzy!

87
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:11,665
It’s all right.
It goes in here.

88
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:16,258
And this goes in here.

89
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,292
All right, your Majesty.
I’m ready.

90
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,094
I’m ready too.
It’s hot in here.

91
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:52,460
That's better.

92
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:56,565
Thank you, Muzzy.
You are clever.

93
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,956
Where's Bob?

94
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:06,089
Bob? Bob the gardener?

95
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:08,133
Oh, look...

96
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:17,369
Come on, Bob!
Great!

97
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,692
-Well done, Bob!
-Come on!

98
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:35,925
-Great.
-Well done, Bob.

99
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:44,085
OK. We've got him.

100
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:46,851
Corvax! Corvax!

101
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:48,489
Wake up!

102
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:53,372
Why?.. What's happening?

103
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,167
Who are you?

104
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:58,049
Where am I?

105
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:00,135
Why am I here?

106
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,348
Who am I?

107
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,354
You are Corvax.
And you are silly.

108
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:09,886
Yes, I’m silly.

109
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,439
No, I’m not. I’m clever.

110
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:17,734
You are not clever, Corvax.

111
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:21,390
Take him away!

112
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:26,065
Yes, take him away!

113
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:51,252
Stand there! Now...

114
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,293
try this.

115
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,255
They're going.

116
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:09,926
They're going
into the computer.

117
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,556
There goes a red one.

118
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,608
There goes a blue.

119
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:18,734
There goes a green one.

120
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,847
A black and white one too.

121
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:25,215
Lots and lots of Sylvias,
coming back this way.

122
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,647
Three cheers for Muzzy.

123
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:30,086
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

124
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,376
Now there are ten of them.

125
00:08:32,556 --> 00:08:34,613
Now there are nine.

126
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,830
Eight, seven, six, five,

127
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:38,848
coming on behind.

128
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:41,267
Four's going in now.

129
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:43,014
There goes number three.

130
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:45,532
Number two and number one.

131
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:49,093
-And that leaves...
-Me!

132
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:52,127
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

133
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:56,917
You and I are happy.

134
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:59,929
A, E, I, O, U.

135
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:04,607
Now we are together.

136
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:07,330
I love you.

137
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:12,206
Who is that beautiful girl?

138
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,248
What is her name?

139
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:16,412
Where does she come from?

140
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,527
When can I see her?

141
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,783
Why am I down here?

142
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:45,006
Now we are together.

143
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,564
I love you.

144
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:56,731
That goes in there.

145
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:59,008
This goes up here.

146
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,402
I don't like this job.

147
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:06,302
-That one.
-This one?

148
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,054
No, the big one.

149
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:11,979
Oh, dear! Oh dear!
Oh dear!

150
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:15,304
Now for that one.

151
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:16,422
This?

152
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:17,771
And that one!

153
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,805
What a dirty job!

154
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:24,660
Now it's lunch-time.

155
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,607
Yes, I'm hungry.

156
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:29,535
-Take all those away.
-Oh dear!

157
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:31,886
Oh dear! Oh dear!

158
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:36,612
Now I'm in my spaceship.

159
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,454
Now I'm going away.

160
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:41,007
Thank you.
Thank you, Muzzy.

161
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:42,968
Please come back some day.

162
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,406
Goodbye! Goodbye!
Goodbye!

163
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:52,006
We're saying goodbye
to Muzzy.

164
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,093
We're saying goodbye to you.

165
00:10:55,816 --> 00:10:58,489
The King, the Queen,

166
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:00,573
Sylvia, Bob,

167
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:03,157
Corvax and Norman too.

168
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:04,992
Goodbye! Goodbye!

169
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:07,053
Goodbye! Goodbye!
