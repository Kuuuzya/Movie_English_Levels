1
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:23,594
- OK, come on.
- Oh, Mike.

2
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:26,263
Follow the sultry sound of my voice.

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,020
- No peeking.
- Mike?

4
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:29,856
And open them.

5
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:32,785
Ta-da!
What do you think?

6
00:00:33,913 --> 00:00:35,872
What was wrong with your old car?

7
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:39,916
<i>Three little words, Sulley:
six wheel drive.</i>

8
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:42,084
Come on.
Get in, get in, get in.

9
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:48,560
It's adjustable.

10
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:09,506
Will you cut it out?!

11
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:15,764
It's like we've released a panther.

12
00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:18,528
What? What, what?

13
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:32,962
Don't just sit there.
Push the button.

14
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:47,614
I'll get it.

15
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,085
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

16
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:01,726
<i>- Hello.
- Push the button.</i>

17
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:31,361
Don't touch anything.
I'll do it.

18
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:09,675
Get out of the car, please.
Get out, out, out, out, out.

19
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:11,840
- Hey, Mike!
- Get out of my car!

20
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:25,370
That's weird.
The air bag didn't go off.

21
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:31,747
I miss my old car.

22
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:34,386
You know...

23
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:36,845
...the vroom, vroom
and the clang, clang

24
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,853
and the bang, bang.

25
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:44,979
You wanna walk?

26
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:47,236
Yes.
